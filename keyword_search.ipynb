Britain will contribute 50 million pounds (US$85 million; euro75 million) to a new international fund that helps poor countries deal with economic shocks, Treasury chief Gordon Brown announced Sunday. The International Monetary Fund scheme will offer relief in the wake of high oil prices, natural disasters, conflicts or other adverse developments. The fund is expected to be capable of subsidizing lending of more than 1.5 billion pounds (US$2.8 billion; euro2.3 billion). Brown said global action is needed in response to the doubling of oil prices over the last year _ \"the largest sustained oil price shock since the 1970s.\" \"This new IMF facility will play a vital role supporting poverty reduction in some of the world's most vulnerable countries, ensuring that development is not undermined by changes in economic conditions, whether those come from terms of trade shocks, high oil prices, or natural disasters,\" he said.</td>\n",

Venezuela has claimed about 600,000 hectares (about 1.5 million acres) of farmlands as state property to be turned over to poor farmers, giving hope to some while raising concern among others about the future of private property in the country. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel defended the agrarian reform program Thursday, saying Venezuela \"is broadening the system of private property\" by making lands available to poor farmers. \"That is social justice,\" he said. The government's National Lands Institute so far has declared 21 ranches to be state property, saying they were determined to be \"idle\" and those who claimed ownership couldn't prove it through documents. The government has helped poor farmers form cooperatives to start to work the land, despite legal challenges from those who used to run the ranches. President Hugo Chavez, who on Thursday took his anti-poverty message to the United Nations, said earlier this week that \"private property has to be subordinate to the general interest.\" However, he has insisted private property rights will be upheld, as outlined in Venezuela's constitution.</td>\n",

The fund, called the Exogenous Shocks Facility, was set up as part of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust following a proposal from the world's richest nations, called the Group of Eight.

In a message marking the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, observed annually on Dec. 2, Ban said that the list of new and old forms of slavery is \"shockingly long.\" That list includes debt bondage, serfdom, forced labor, child labor and servitude, trafficking of persons and human organs, sexual slavery, forced marriage, the exploitation of prostitutes and the use of child soldiers. \"The majority who suffer are the poor and socially excluded groups such as minorities and migrants,\" said Ban. \"The overlapping factors of poverty, class and race create structural problems and cycles of marginalization that are hard to break.\" The secretary-general noted that gender inequalities, lack of education, desperation for work and demand for cheap labor also trap people in a life of subjugation, a vulnerability the global economic and financial crises threaten to heighten.</td>\n",

Parliament on Sunday took up measures meant to bring Chinese law into line with a more open, capitalist-style economy by protecting private property and equalizing taxes for foreign and domestic companies. The proposed property law is the most controversial measure to come before parliament in recent years. Earlier versions prompted an outcry by leftists, who complained it would undermine state control of the economy and worsen the growing gap between an elite who have profited from China's reforms and the poor majority. The National People's Congress began considering a seventh draft on Sunday that \"strikes a balance between private property and state ownership,\" said the official Xinhua News Agency. It said backers hoped to pass it when the NPC holds its next full meeting in March. The Communist Party amended the constitution in 2004 to enshrine private property rights for the first time since its 1949 revolution. That followed two decades of reform that let hundreds of millions of Chinese lift themselves out of poverty as entrepreneurs started businesses, bought homes and traded stocks. The debate over legal changes meant to enforce such protections highlights enduring concern about the impact of China's rapid but uneven growth, which has set off protests over poverty, taxes and seizures of farmland for redevelopment.</td>\n",

The equivalent of a third of the world's population has already been affected by weather- related disasters and this is set to soar because of climate change unless urgent international action is taken, according to a report issued here this week. Governments must commit at least 50 billion U.S. dollars every year to helping the world's most vulnerable communities prepare to save their own lives and livelihoods, says the report \"Climate of Disaster\" published by Tearfund, one of the UK's leading relief and development agencies. In the past 10 years, weather-related disasters have killed over 443,000 people, affected 2.5 billion people and cost an estimated 600 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses. With climate change increasing the number and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts, more and more people are becoming vulnerable to a range of environmental disasters, according to the report. Without urgent action, this trend is set to rise, leading to unprecedented levels of suffering and deaths. Poor people will be hit hardest as they are the least able to cope, and live in the most vulnerable areas of the world. With each new disaster, precious gains made in poverty eradication are swept away, warns the report. The following are the key highlights from the report \"Climate of Disaster\":</td>\n",

Ali said the theme of this year's International Day for Disaster Reduction is \"turning the tide on disasters towards sustainable development,\" adding that \"this theme is reminds us that the task is not just to effectively respond to disasters in order to save lives, but more to reduce the chances of hazards turning into disasters, taking life away and destroying development gains.\" \"In Uganda, drought, floods, landslides, windstorms and hailstorms destroy an average of 800,000 hectares of crops making economic loses in excess of 60 million US dollars every year. Economic loses resulting from transport accidents and fires is estimated 25 million dollars annually. Death tolls resulting from natural and man-made disasters exceed 5,000 annually.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation responsible for the survey said it challenged the fundamental belief that home ownership in the United Kingdom  equated with wealth, and urged the government to rethink its benefits policy as a result of its findings. The research found that two-thirds of mortgage holders and 18 percent of home buyers who owned their property outright were classed as poor. Mortgage holders were more likely to live in poverty if they were young, aged between 24 and 35, were manual workers, out of work, lone parents, or came from a black or ethnic minority group. Among homeowners, families with children living at home or university were most likely to be the poorest, said the research.

CONTEXT Composing the most disaster-prone region of the  world and home to more than a third of the world's population,  Asian countries suffer disasters every year. The increasing  vulnerability of people in Asia is largely related to the  demographic conditions, rapid technological and socio-economic  changes, hugely expanding urbanization and development within high risk environment, among other conditions. The impact of such  catastrophic events in Asia as the frequently occurring typhoons  and tropical cyclones, annual floods of increasing severity, the  Bam earthquake in Iran in 2003, and especially the Indian Ocean  tsunami of 2004 underline the costs of the loss of lives,  livelihoods and material damages. Additional impacts go far beyond direct social and economic costs in the resulting and often  long-termed psychological and frequently pervasive public health  or environmental shocks to Asian societies. Given the numerical magnitudes, professional talents and  dynamic features of many Asian economies and their importance to  world trade and commerce, no country in the world today is immune  to disasters. The current global concern about the rapid  international spread of a possible pandemic disease such as Avian  Flu is only one example that conveys both the urgency and the  necessity of sustained investment in widespread public awareness  on disaster risks and governmental commitments to disaster  preparedness, response and reduction through regional cooperation. Recurring disasters pose a great development challenge for all  countries in Asia. The impact of disasters is on the rise and the  need for relief assistance is increasing. Therefore, increasing  emergency relief assistance reduces resources for development  expenditure. Also, disaster events push socio-economically  marginalized people into poverty, increasing their dependency on  natural resources. This, in turn, degrades the environment and  further increases their vulnerability to disaster risk. To break  such a negative cycle and to sustain socio-economic development,  disaster risk reduction should become an integral part of  sustainable development, evident in all annual programming  actions. Meanwhile, there is now a clear understanding that the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) cannot be achieved without  consideration of disaster risk, and that sustainable development  cannot be achieved unless disaster risk reduction is mainstreamed  into development policies, planning and implementation. It is  widely acknowledged that disaster reduction perspectives should be incorporated into every country's national development plans and  related implementation strategies. The good news, however, is that technology now provides the capability of and opportunity for  better understanding of disaster risks and taking proactive  actions to reduce disaster losses before they occur. This context has influenced the outcome document of WCDR: the  Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of  Nations and Communities to Disasters. This document was adopted by the UN Member States that participated in the WCDR, demonstrating  a global commitment to disaster risk reduction in the context of  development.</td>\n",

The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22: It is so easy to sit back in the affluence of our comfortable lives, protected from scourges like malaria and extreme poverty and hunger, and nitpick to death the United Nations' landmark action plan to eradicate poverty and hunger and the plagues they spawn. Indeed, no sooner had the long-awaited report, bearing the stamp of the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, hit the street this week than some economists took shots. \"Utopian central planning by global bureaucrats,\" carped one. There is certainly much to debate about the details of Sachs' report, which calls for rich countries like the United States to drastically increase foreign aid to poor countries in an effort to halve poverty in its many forms -- hunger, illiteracy, disease -- by 2015. But this is not a time for armchair quarterbacking. The U.N. report is a bold initiative that refuses to accept hunger as the inevitable fate of so many Africans, Latin Americans and Asians. There will be and should be a debate about it as world leaders prepare to meet in September on the anti-poverty goals, but it is vital that it not turn into another excuse for inaction. Sachs' report lays out, in real terms, the myriad ways to help poor people. The beauty of his ideas is in their simplicity: Provide mosquito nets for children who live in malaria-infested regions. Eliminate school and uniform fees to ensure that poor children don't stay home because they can't afford to go to school. Provide farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with soil nutrients to ensure healthier crops. Reform and enforce legislation guaranteeing women and girls property and inheritance rights. None of this is rocket science, although many will try to make it seem so. The strongest, and probably most legitimate, critique of approaches that flood poor countries with money is that many of these poor countries are run by corrupt governments that will stash most of the donor money in private Swiss bank accounts. That has certainly proved true in the past, particularly in Africa, where the poor have stayed poor while a succession of despots have run country after country into the ground.</td>\n",

The problem of hunger and food insecurity is not simply about finding ways of increasing agricultural production, but needs to be addressed as a multi-dimensional issue, the president of the U.N. General Assembly said here today. Speaking at a meeting observing World Food Day at the U.N. headquarters, Razali Ismail, president of the U.N. General Assembly, said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights pronounced freedom from hunger as one of the \"inalienable and inviolable rights of all members of the human family.\" However, a staggering 800 million people are chronically undernourished though the world now produces enough food for all its inhabitants, he said. On dealing with the issue, he said that the huge dimensions of hunger and food insecurity are closely linked to poverty and land tenure issues, to unsustainable production and consumption patterns, to property rights regimes that erode the diversity of genetic resources, to the impact of technology on small producers, the role of women in agrarian communities, and the multiple guises of power politics which commodify food as political and economic weapons in the globalized market place. \"The United Nations must always be on the side of equity and social justice, and protect the interests of the marginalized and the poor. To do so in the case of food security and in the pursuit of eliminating hunger would mean finding the political ways and economic means to protect the interests, rights and traditional skills of farmers and those that `cannot sleep because of hunger,'\" he said.</td>\n",

Hunger now afflicts 830 million people around the world because of natural disasters, armed conflict and a grinding poverty that consigns the poor to chronic malnutrition, the U.N. World Food Program reported Monday. ``From generation to generation, people don't have enough food to eat,'' Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director, said at a news briefing, where she distributed a map identifying ``hot spots'' where hunger is most severe. The map identifies large swathes of territory in sub-Sahara Africa and Asia where tens of millions of people, most of them women and children, cannot get enough to eat. ``The combination of poverty and disaster causes people to have even less possibility to build resources to end their hunger,'' Bertini said. The World Food Program defines hunger as a condition in which people fail to get enough food to provide the nutrients for active, healthy lives. Those who are considered undernourished subsist on 1,800 calories a day or less. The figure of 2,100 is generally recommended to sustain an average adult. Although the data the program uses was collected for the period 1995-1997, officials said that their research shows that the scope of the problem has not improved, and in some places is getting worse.</td>\n",

There are some core principles on which the plan was based, said the communiqu.An enduring and meaningful poverty reduction can not be achieved without inclusive, sustainable and resilient growth. Partnership should be established among developing countries and priority should be put on global or regional systematic issues that call for collective action.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Vietnam Intensifies Efforts on Poverty Eradication. Vietnam is intensifying its efforts on hunger alleviation and poverty reduction by striving to help some 300,000 poor households escape hunger this year. Vietnam has planned to reduce the rate of poverty-stricken households nationwide to 13.7 percent this year, Vietnam News Agency Saturday quoted Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs as saying. Vietnam now has 2.4 million households classified as poor, accounting for 15.7 percent of the total population. There are almost 1,500 poor communes nationwide each with more than 40 percent of their households classified as in poverty. Hunger and poverty eradication has been set as a major policy and an important undertaking by the Vietnamese government. The hunger alleviation and poverty reduction program started in 1992. The Vietnamese government planned to allocate 900 billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (64.3 million U.S. dollars) to the national program on hunger elimination and poverty reduction this year with 70 percent being channeled to the 1,000 poorest communes nationwide.</td>\n",

Man-made disasters and natural hazards such as armed conflicts, floods, drought, famine, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions cost Africa 15 billion US dollars last year, according to a WHO meeting closed here on Friday. The find is contained in a paper prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa for review at a roundtable of African health and development experts and officials, which was held on the sidelines of the 53rd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa taking place on Sept. 1-5 here. \"The recurring humanitarian crises within the African Region erodes decades of development achievement, further entrenching poverty and inequality,\" the paper said, illustrating the point with the recent earthquake in Algeria which clamed 2,300 lives, left 15,000 people injured, and caused financial losses estimated at 5 billion dollars. Another \"striking\" illustration of the consequences of disasters in the region is the floods which ravaged Mozambique in 2000, causing losses of more than 427 million dollars. Recent and ongoing emergencies in the region have caused millions of deaths and incalculable human suffering in Africa.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Zambians march to call on rich nations to act on promises. Hundreds of Zambians from civil  society organizations marched through the capital Friday, urging  the world's rich nations to act on promises to help African  countries get out of poverty. The march, coming ahead of the Group 8 club of industrial  nations meeting in Britain next week, is part of a global call for action against poverty, debt and trade injustice demanded by poor  nations. The demonstrators, carrying placards and singing anti-slavery  songs, marched along Cairo road in the city center to the freedom  statue where speeches were made. One placard said \"G-8 nations,  you promise act now!\" \"We are calling on rich nations to act on their promises so  that we can move out of poverty. The rich nations should be told  that debt is a form of slavery and should be fought the same way  human slavery was fought,\" John Phiri from Global Justice Zambia  told the demonstrators. He said Africa will not meet the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs) if rich nations do not open up markets and increase official development assistance to the continent.</td>\n",

       "      <td>China Unveils New Measures for Birth Control. A scheme to integrate family planning work with aid-the-poor projects is expected to speed up birth control in the backward rural areas. The State Family Planning Commission (SFPC) is now striving to combine birth-control work with economic development, with the object of helping farmers get rich and at the same time promote cultural progress in the countryside. The new approach, first carried out in northeast China's Jilin Province, has been praised by Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister in charge of the SFPC, as a \"road of hope for rural family planning\". At a meeting held at the end of 1994 in Sichuan, the most populous province in China, the approach won support from family planning officials from throughout the country, and a decision was made to carry it out nationwide as a basic principle for the current and future population-control work. Senior SFPC officials said that they believed that the new principle will be helpful for breaking out of the vicious circle of \"poverty-more children-poverty\" and for triggering a revolution in people's attitudes towards birth control through economic development.</td>\n",

Britain will contribute 50 million pounds (US$85 million; euro75 million) to a new international fund that helps poor countries deal with economic shocks, Treasury chief Gordon Brown announced Sunday. The International Monetary Fund scheme will offer relief in the wake of high oil prices, natural disasters, conflicts or other adverse developments. The fund is expected to be capable of subsidizing lending of more than 1.5 billion pounds (US$2.8 billion; euro2.3 billion). Brown said global action is needed in response to the doubling of oil prices over the last year _ \"the largest sustained oil price shock since the 1970s.\" \"This new IMF facility will play a vital role supporting poverty reduction in some of the world's most vulnerable countries, ensuring that development is not undermined by changes in economic conditions, whether those come from terms of trade shocks, high oil prices, or natural disasters,\" he said.   \n",

Venezuela has claimed about 600,000 hectares (about 1.5 million acres) of farmlands as state property to be turned over to poor farmers, giving hope to some while raising concern among others about the future of private property in the country. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel defended the agrarian reform program Thursday, saying Venezuela \"is broadening the system of private property\" by making lands available to poor farmers. \"That is social justice,\" he said. The government's National Lands Institute so far has declared 21 ranches to be state property, saying they were determined to be \"idle\" and those who claimed ownership couldn't prove it through documents. The government has helped poor farmers form cooperatives to start to work the land, despite legal challenges from those who used to run the ranches. President Hugo Chavez, who on Thursday took his anti-poverty message to the United Nations, said earlier this week that \"private property has to be subordinate to the general interest.\" However, he has insisted private property rights will be upheld, as outlined in Venezuela's constitution.   \n",

Norway pledged 240 million kroner (US$35.5 million or euro30 million) on Wednesday to a new global fund to help poor countries deal with economic shocks. The program was set up by the International Monetary Fund in November to provide highly subsidized loans to poor countries when their economies are hit by war, natural disaster or extreme fluctuations in import or export prices. \"This new scheme will act as a buffer and will help to ensure continuity in the fight against poverty, even in cases where vulnerable, poor countries have to deal with sudden severe economic shocks due to external circumstances,\" Norwegian Aid Minister Erik Solheim said. The fund, called the Exogenous Shocks Facility, was set up as part of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust following a proposal from the world's richest nations, called the Group of Eight. Norway, which is rich on offshore oil, is the world's largest foreign aid donor per capita.   \n",

Contemporary forms of slavery remain a \"grave and unresolved problem\" across all continents, UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon warned on Wednesday, calling for greater efforts to address poverty and social inequalities which leave people vulnerable to enslavement. In a message marking the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, observed annually on Dec. 2, Ban said that the list of new and old forms of slavery is \"shockingly long.\" That list includes debt bondage, serfdom, forced labor, child labor and servitude, trafficking of persons and human organs, sexual slavery, forced marriage, the exploitation of prostitutes and the use of child soldiers. \"The majority who suffer are the poor and socially excluded groups such as minorities and migrants,\" said Ban. \"The overlapping factors of poverty, class and race create structural problems and cycles of marginalization that are hard to break.\" The secretary-general noted that gender inequalities, lack of education, desperation for work and demand for cheap labor also trap people in a life of subjugation, a vulnerability the global economic and financial crises threaten to heighten.   \n",

Britain plans to contribute as much as 50  million pounds (85 million dollars, 73 million euros) to the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help poor countries deal with  economic shocks, the British finance minister said Sunday. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said \"this new IMF  facility will play a vital role supporting poverty reduction in some  of the world's most vulnerable countries, ensuring that development  is not undermined by changes in economic conditions, whether those  come from terms of trade shocks, high oil prices or natural  disasters.\" Brown also said that France and Saudi Arabia also have promised  to make contributions. \"But further contributions are needed from other donors --  including from oil producers -- to fund the new facility in full,\"  Brown added.   \n",

Parliament on Sunday took up measures meant to bring Chinese law into line with a more open, capitalist-style economy by protecting private property and equalizing taxes for foreign and domestic companies. The proposed property law is the most controversial measure to come before parliament in recent years. Earlier versions prompted an outcry by leftists, who complained it would undermine state control of the economy and worsen the growing gap between an elite who have profited from China's reforms and the poor majority. The National People's Congress began considering a seventh draft on Sunday that \"strikes a balance between private property and state ownership,\" said the official Xinhua News Agency. It said backers hoped to pass it when the NPC holds its next full meeting in March. The Communist Party amended the constitution in 2004 to enshrine private property rights for the first time since its 1949 revolution. That followed two decades of reform that let hundreds of millions of Chinese lift themselves out of poverty as entrepreneurs started businesses, bought homes and traded stocks. The debate over legal changes meant to enforce such protections highlights enduring concern about the impact of China's rapid but uneven growth, which has set off protests over poverty, taxes and seizures of farmland for redevelopment.   \n",

The equivalent of a third of the world's population has already been affected by weather- related disasters and this is set to soar because of climate change unless urgent international action is taken, according to a report issued here this week. Governments must commit at least 50 billion U.S. dollars every year to helping the world's most vulnerable communities prepare to save their own lives and livelihoods, says the report \"Climate of Disaster\" published by Tearfund, one of the UK's leading relief and development agencies. In the past 10 years, weather-related disasters have killed over 443,000 people, affected 2.5 billion people and cost an estimated 600 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses. With climate change increasing the number and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts, more and more people are becoming vulnerable to a range of environmental disasters, according to the report. Without urgent action, this trend is set to rise, leading to unprecedented levels of suffering and deaths. Poor people will be hit hardest as they are the least able to cope, and live in the most vulnerable areas of the world. With each new disaster, precious gains made in poverty eradication are swept away, warns the report. The following are the key highlights from the report \"Climate of Disaster\":   \n",

President Bill Clinton announced Saturday that he was asking a task force for ideas on how to expand home ownership to include more poor and minority buyers. In an address to the National Association of Realtors, the president said that home ownership had been sliding since 1980. \"We have to turn this around ... and I am convinced that we can do it,\" he said, saying his goal was to bring home ownership to \"an all time high in the US before the century is over.\" To accomplish this, Clinton said he had asked Henry Cisneros, the secretary of housing and urban development, to create a task force that drew on such diverse groups as real estate agents, mortgage bankers, urban development experts and anti-poverty workers. They would draw up a strategy and report to the White House within six months, Clinton said.   \n",

Ugandans on Wednesday were called to reduce the number and impact of disasters by building sustainable communities that have the long-term capacity to live with risk. The call was contained in a statement issued by Lt. Gen. Moses Ali, first deputy prime minister and minister for disaster preparedness and refugees, to mark the International Day for Disaster Reduction which falls on Oct. 8, 2003. Ali said the theme of this year's International Day for Disaster Reduction is \"turning the tide on disasters towards sustainable development,\" adding that \"this theme is reminds us that the task is not just to effectively respond to disasters in order to save lives, but more to reduce the chances of hazards turning into disasters, taking life away and destroying development gains.\" \"In Uganda, drought, floods, landslides, windstorms and hailstorms destroy an average of 800,000 hectares of crops making economic loses in excess of 60 million US dollars every year. Economic loses resulting from transport accidents and fires is estimated 25 million dollars annually. Death tolls resulting from natural and man-made disasters exceed 5,000 annually. Between 1980 and 2003, 1 in 30 people in Uganda were affected by a natural or man-made disaster and fell into the poverty bracket,\" he noted. \"At intervals of 5 to 10 years, an earthquake occurs in western Uganda destroying infrastructure and property estimated at over 40 million dollars. Also between 3 and 5 years periodically an El Nino rain phenomenon occurs followed by a severe drought in Uganda, also causing destruction to property and infrastructure estimated at over 200 million dollars,\" he said.   \n",

By spending more aid money on getting poor countries ready for disasters, rich nations could save thousands of lives, face smaller bills after floods or hurricanes, and boost the fight against poverty, the international Red Cross said Wednesday. The World Disasters Report, issued annually by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the economic and social cost of such events could be slashed if donors used their money more wisely _ before, rather than just after high profile disasters. ``Disasters aren't just little blips on the development curve,'' said Red Cross official Peter Walker, who edited the 239-page study. ``If we don't take them into account then we haven't got a chance'' of lifting poor countries out of poverty. Walker said donors should think like investors and target a larger proportion of their foreign aid to disaster preparedness. He did not suggest figures, but said the sums involved would be less than the current dlrs 6.3 billion a year it costs to rebuild after a catastrophe. The report said the number of people affected by natural and manmade disasters climbed to 170 million last year from an annual 70 million in the 1970s.   \n",

Improving the basic production and living conditions of the poor areas. Construction of basic farmland, infrastructure, environmental improvement projects and public service facilities will be strengthened with the township or village as the basic unit. By 2010, the drinking water problem for both people and livestock will be basically solved in the key state-helped poor areas, and at the same time efforts will be made to provide most of the administrative villages with electricity, road access, and postal, telephone, radio and TV links. In addition, hospitals will be built in most of the poor townships, and clinics in most of the poor villages, so as to basically control the main endemic diseases seriously affecting the life and production of those areas. -- Improving the sci-tech and cultural qualities of the masses in the poor areas. In order to help the peasants acquire advanced and practical techniques, it is necessary to integrate agriculture, science and education, make overall plans for general, vocational and adult education, and run vocational and technical schools and short-term training classes with clear aims in mind. The nine-year compulsory education will be guaranteed in the poor areas, and the attendance rate of school-age children will be further raised. The old backward habits and customs will be changed, and a scientific and civilized life-style will be promoted in those areas. -- Encouraging economic organizations with diverse forms of ownership to assist with the development of the poor areas. The Chinese government will create a better policy and investment environment to attract economic organizations with diverse forms of ownership to help the economic development of the poor areas. Necessary support will be given by the state to agricultural products processing enterprises that meet the demands of the market and can upgrade their industries and help increase the incomes of thousand and one households; resource-exploitation enterprises that will give full play to the resource advantages of the poor areas and improve their eco-environment; labor-intensive enterprises that can provide employment for the surplus labor force in the poor areas; and enterprises that can help the poor and needy solve the problem of market circulation.   \n",

Half the adults in Britain who are \" poor\" are homeowners and thus receive little or no state help, says research published on Wednesday. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation responsible for the survey said it challenged the fundamental belief that home ownership in the United Kingdom  equated with wealth, and urged the government to rethink its benefits policy as a result of its findings. The research found that two-thirds of mortgage holders and 18 percent of home buyers who owned their property outright were classed as poor. Mortgage holders were more likely to live in poverty if they were young, aged between 24 and 35, were manual workers, out of work, lone parents, or came from a black or ethnic minority group. Among homeowners, families with children living at home or university were most likely to be the poorest, said the research. It also found that poor people who owned their properties outright were most likely to be elderly.   \n",

Health workers from 10 developing nations began sharing ideas on containing population growth Monday at the beginning of a three-day conference in Bangladesh. ``The exceptional progress Bangladesh has made in population control and female education stands as testimony to what developing nations can achieve in a difficult situation,'' Steven Sinding, Director at The Rockefeller Foundation, told the delegates. Sponsored by Partners in Population and Development, the meeting brings together private and government health workers from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Thailand, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. Fast population growth, which is linked to poverty, hunger and disease, is one of the common problems facing these countries. Bangladesh has deployed an army of more than 35,000 government and volunteer health workers to make information, birth control pills, condoms and male and female sterilization available across the country.   \n",

The provincial trade union of Liaoning, a heavy industry base in northeast China, has pledged to be the first source of aid for poverty-haunted workers. Liaoning will set up a network for these workers to ensure they receive all the benefits and social security they are entitled to. Trade unions at all level must guarantee that no poor workers or their families suffer, said Zhang Zhenxi, vice-chairman of the provincial trade union. Zhang said trade unions should spare no efforts to care for poor workers and provide their families with money, clothing, and food. He said that officials will aid 5,000 additional poor households this year in order to help them eventually escape poverty.   \n",

The Red Cross warned on Wednesday that international pledges to halve world poverty or hunger by 2015 will not be met unless more efforts are made to reduce the impact of natural disasters. In its annual World Disasters Report, a group of experts commissioned by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that prevention efforts were neglected and called for targets to be set to reduce the risk from disasters. It advocated a target of halving the number of deaths caused by storms, floods or drought. \"Disasters can wipe out years of development in a matter of hours,\" Federation Secretary-General Dider Cherpitel noted in the report. The number of people affected by natural disasters -- rendered homeless or had their lives harshened as a result of floods, drought or landslides -- has trebled to two billion since the 1990s, according to the Red Cross.   \n",

The 4th summit of the  Association of Caribbean States, to be held Thursday in Panama,  will address key issues of poverty, hunger, malnutrition, energy  and natural disasters in the region, sources from the Panamanian  governmnet said Monday. The Organization of American states (OAS) and the UN World Food Program (WFP)  will present at the summit. The WFP is expected to present at the meeting a report on how  to fight hunger and malnutrition in the region. The regional WFP office in Panama  has drafted a program on the dignity of people and \"the real distribution\" of food for people  left outside the official development plans. The summit will put forth a rapid assistance program both to  prevent and to respond to natural disasters.   \n",

The World Bank said that some 750 million people go hungry every day in today's world. The persistence of hunger in the world has posed one of the most daunting development challenges facing the global community today, the World Bank said in a strategy statement Wednesday. \"If we want to reduce hunger effectively, we have to reduce poverty,\" the Bank's President Lewis T. Preston said in a foreword to the report: \"The World Bank's Strategy for Reducing Poverty and Hunger.\" Contrary to popular perception, not all hunger is caused by droughts, famines, and wars, the report said. The more subtle form of hunger, that is chronic, widespread and deep-rooted, is \"silent hunger\" caused by people lacking the capacity to produce food or the income to buy it. \"People-centered policies work best in combating hunger and poverty,\" said Ismail Serageldin, the Bank's vice-president, under whose direction the report was accomplished. \"Ample evidence exists to show that broad-based, sustainable economic growth coupled with improved access to education, health care and social services reduces poverty and goes a long way to fighting hunger,\" added Serageldin.   \n",

Poverty reduction will require a more comprehensive approach that directly addresses the needs of poor people in three important areas of opportunity, empowerment, and security, said the latest World Bank annual report available here Saturday. The World Development Report 2000-2001 \"Attacking Poverty\" recommends that governments of the developing countries at all levels, donor countries, international agencies, non-government- organizations, civil society and local communities should be mobilized behind three priority areas: -- Opportunity: Expanding economic opportunity for poor people by stimulating economic growth, making markets work better for poor people, and working for their inclusion, particularly by building up their assets such as land and education. -- Empowerment: Strengthening the ability of poor people to shape decisions that affect their lives and removing discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity and social status. -- Security: Reducing poor people's vulnerability to sickness, economic shocks, crop failure, unemployment, natural disasters and violence, and helping them cope with when such misfortunes occur.   \n",

EMBARGO, NOT FOR PUBLICATION BEFORE 0001GMT JUNE 19 /// GENEVA, June 19 (AFP) - The Red Cross warned on Wednesday that international pledges to halve world poverty or hunger by 2015 will not be met unless more efforts are made to reduce the impact of natural disasters. In its annual World Disasters Report, a group of experts commissioned by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that prevention efforts were neglected and called for targets to be set to reduce the risk from disasters. It advocated a target of halving the number of deaths caused by storms, floods or drought. \"Disasters can wipe out years of development in a matter of hours,\" Federation Secretary-General Dider Cherpitel noted in the report.   \n",

Disasters caused by climate change will inflict the highest losses in poor countries with weak governments that have dashed for growth and failed to shield populations which settle in exposed areas, a UN report said on Thursday. \"Disaster risk is not evenly distributed,\" said the report, released on the sidelines of the world climate talks in Bonn, as it urged countries to shore up protection for their citizens. From 1990 to 2007, loss of life and property from weather-related disasters rose significantly, with floods the biggest single cause, it said. Large developing countries, led by China, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, suffered the biggest mortality in absolute terms, but in relation to population, the highest tolls were in Dominica, Vanuatu and Myanmar. Poor small-island states and poor landlocked states, which can suffer years-long economic damage after an extreme weather event, are most in the firing line, according to the report, \"Risk and Poverty in a Changing Climate.\"   \n",

The African countries are offered favorable proposals on African agricultural development with a call to carry out green revolution at the 22nd Africa-France summit held in Paris from Feb. 20-21. With 40 million Africans facing famine and 70 percent of population tied up in agricultural sector, agriculture is believed a crucial part of African development and emerged as a hot topic at the summit. \"Agricultural development is vital for sub-Saharan Africa to attain the 7-percent average annual growth rate that will enable it to achieve the millennium goal,\" French President Jacques Chirac said to 43 African heads of states and government, noting the issue \"dear to his heart.\" He calls for a long-term response to famine in Africa, encouraging African countries to develop ambitious agricultural policies. \"Agriculture has been the poor relative of development policies in recent years, despite the fact that the construction of sound agricultural sectors is the surest way of eliminating hunger and poverty in Africa,\" he said.   \n",

Many of the 450 million agricultural  workers are suffering from some of the highest incidences of  poverty and hunger, according to a report published by the United  Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Thursday. Of a total workforce in agriculture of some 1.1 billion people, waged agricultural workers account for around 40 percent,  according to a joint report by FAO, the International Labor  Organization and the International Union of Food, Agricultural,  Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers'  Associations. \"Agriculture cannot be sustainable whilst over 40 percent of  the workforce suffer precarious employment and poor working  conditions, and live in poverty,\" the report said. Economic pressures are eroding the already low levels of  protection of agricultural workers in terms of wage levels, job  security, health, safety and environmental standards and social  protection, the report said. Agricultural workers, who do not own or rent the land on which  they work, are often poorly paid, earning wages well below those  earned by industrial workers. In general, worker households spend  over 70 percent of their cash salary on food, according to the  report.   \n",

Rich nations could save thousands of lives, face smaller bills after floods or hurricanes, and boost the fight against poverty if they helped poor countries prepare for disasters, the international Red Cross said Wednesday. The World Disasters Report, issued annually by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the economic and social cost of such events could be slashed if donors used their money more wisely _ before, rather than only after catastrophes. ``Disasters aren't just little blips on the development curve,'' said Red Cross official Peter Walker, who edited the 239-page study. ``If we don't take them into account, then we haven't got a chance'' of lifting poor countries out of poverty. Walker said donors should think like investors and target a larger proportion of their foreign aid to disaster preparedness. He did not suggest figures, but said the sums involved would be less than the current dlrs 6.3 billion a year it costs to rebuild after catastrophes. The report said the number of people affected by natural and manmade disasters climbed to 170 million last year, from 70 million people a year in the 1970s.   \n",
       "1493  Full text: Beijing Action for Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia (2). I. CONTEXT Composing the most disaster-prone region of the  world and home to more than a third of the world's population,  Asian countries suffer disasters every year. The increasing  vulnerability of people in Asia is largely related to the  demographic conditions, rapid technological and socio-economic  changes, hugely expanding urbanization and development within high risk environment, among other conditions. The impact of such  catastrophic events in Asia as the frequently occurring typhoons  and tropical cyclones, annual floods of increasing severity, the  Bam earthquake in Iran in 2003, and especially the Indian Ocean  tsunami of 2004 underline the costs of the loss of lives,  livelihoods and material damages. Additional impacts go far beyond direct social and economic costs in the resulting and often  long-termed psychological and frequently pervasive public health  or environmental shocks to Asian societies. Given the numerical magnitudes, professional talents and  dynamic features of many Asian economies and their importance to  world trade and commerce, no country in the world today is immune  to disasters. The current global concern about the rapid  international spread of a possible pandemic disease such as Avian  Flu is only one example that conveys both the urgency and the  necessity of sustained investment in widespread public awareness  on disaster risks and governmental commitments to disaster  preparedness, response and reduction through regional cooperation. Recurring disasters pose a great development challenge for all  countries in Asia. The impact of disasters is on the rise and the  need for relief assistance is increasing. Therefore, increasing  emergency relief assistance reduces resources for development  expenditure. Also, disaster events push socio-economically  marginalized people into poverty, increasing their dependency on  natural resources. This, in turn, degrades the environment and  further increases their vulnerability to disaster risk. To break  such a negative cycle and to sustain socio-economic development,  disaster risk reduction should become an integral part of  sustainable development, evident in all annual programming  actions. Meanwhile, there is now a clear understanding that the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) cannot be achieved without  consideration of disaster risk, and that sustainable development  cannot be achieved unless disaster risk reduction is mainstreamed  into development policies, planning and implementation. It is  widely acknowledged that disaster reduction perspectives should be incorporated into every country's national development plans and  related implementation strategies. The good news, however, is that technology now provides the capability of and opportunity for  better understanding of disaster risks and taking proactive  actions to reduce disaster losses before they occur.

Epidemics and natural disasters are on the rise around the world, especially in underdeveloped countries where expanding urban slums pose health hazards, according to a Red Cross report presented Thursday. The 200-page 1999 World Disasters Report said global warming, deforestation and urban crowding and poverty in the developing world are escalating the spread of contagious and deadly diseases and have left populations vulnerable to natural disasters. ``The developing world will continue to be hardest hit by the escalating effects of human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population pressures,'' said the report that was presented at the start of a two-day seminar in the Ugandan capital on preparing for and averting disasters. Red Cross regional spokesman John Sparrow said his agency had chosen to launch the report in Uganda because of the East African country's dedication to disaster-preparedness. Jane Francis Kuka, State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, said she found the report disturbing.   \n",

Contemporary forms of slavery remain a \"grave\" and unresolved problem across all continents, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned here Wednesday as he called for greater efforts to address poverty and social inequalities which leave people vulnerable to enslavement. In message marking the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, observed annually on Dec. 2, Ban said that the list of new and old forms of slavery is \"shockingly long.\" That list includes debt bondage, serfdom, forced labor, child labor and servitude, trafficking of persons and human organs, sexual slavery, forced marriage, the exploitation of prostitutes and the use of child soldiers among others, he said. \"The majority who suffer are the poor and socially excluded groups such as minorities and migrants,\" the secretary-general said. \"The overlapping factors of poverty, class and race create structural problems and cycles of marginalization that are hard to break.\" The secretary-general noted that gender inequalities, lack of education, desperation for work and demand for cheap labor also trap people in a life of subjugation, a vulnerability the global economic and financial crises threaten to heighten.   \n",

Chilean President Eduardo Frei said today that the nation's economic development should go hand in hand with improvements of the people's livelihood. He stated that the Ministry of National Property is a key influence in overcoming poverty. Frei made these statements in his speech during a ceremony turning over property deeds today. This year 345,000 poor families will receive property deeds, which will allow them to enter into a different type of life, through subsidies, technical support and other measures.   \n",

The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22: It is so easy to sit back in the affluence of our comfortable lives, protected from scourges like malaria and extreme poverty and hunger, and nitpick to death the United Nations' landmark action plan to eradicate poverty and hunger and the plagues they spawn. Indeed, no sooner had the long-awaited report, bearing the stamp of the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, hit the street this week than some economists took shots. \"Utopian central planning by global bureaucrats,\" carped one. There is certainly much to debate about the details of Sachs' report, which calls for rich countries like the United States to drastically increase foreign aid to poor countries in an effort to halve poverty in its many forms -- hunger, illiteracy, disease -- by 2015. But this is not a time for armchair quarterbacking. The U.N. report is a bold initiative that refuses to accept hunger as the inevitable fate of so many Africans, Latin Americans and Asians. There will be and should be a debate about it as world leaders prepare to meet in September on the anti-poverty goals, but it is vital that it not turn into another excuse for inaction. Sachs' report lays out, in real terms, the myriad ways to help poor people. The beauty of his ideas is in their simplicity: Provide mosquito nets for children who live in malaria-infested regions. Eliminate school and uniform fees to ensure that poor children don't stay home because they can't afford to go to school. Provide farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with soil nutrients to ensure healthier crops. Reform and enforce legislation guaranteeing women and girls property and inheritance rights. None of this is rocket science, although many will try to make it seem so. The strongest, and probably most legitimate, critique of approaches that flood poor countries with money is that many of these poor countries are run by corrupt governments that will stash most of the donor money in private Swiss bank accounts. That has certainly proved true in the past, particularly in Africa, where the poor have stayed poor while a succession of despots have run country after country into the ground.   \n",

Despite \"green shoots\" of recovery, the world economic financial and economic crisis is still not over yet, at least for the millions of the most vulnerable who cannot make the ends meet everyday, the United Nations warned on Friday. \"The 'near poor' are becoming the 'new poor,'\" UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha- Rose Migiro told reporters in New York at the launch of the Voices of the Vulnerable: the Economic Crisis from the Ground Up report. The crisis, the worse of its kind since the 1930s, continues to push millions of people into poverty and is reversing some of the hard-won development gains of the past decade, the report said. \"Workers in both the formal and informal sectors are being badly hit, particularly in manufacturing, commerce and construction,\" said Migiro, before quoting one construction worker who said that the \"monster\" economic crisis is \"devouring the poor. \" She added that migrants are finding their situation increasingly precarious, with forecasts predicting that remittances to developing countries will be reduced by over seven percent this year.   \n",

The Philippines is naturally prone  to disasters but rising poverty and climate change are making the  problem steadily worse, analysts said. Despite repeated disasters, many people are too poor to leave  dangerous areas, they say. Some 30,000 people fled the Mayon volcano when it started  rumbling in August only to return when the activity subsided. But  this week, typhoon-triggered mudslides swept hundreds of these  people to their deaths. Roger-Mark De Souza of the Washington-based Population Reference  Bureau said the danger from natural disasters here has risen  markedly in recent years. \"The risk to human life from natural disasters in the  Philippines has increased dramatically over the past generation,\" he  said in a recent report.   \n",

The problem of hunger and food insecurity is not simply about finding ways of increasing agricultural production, but needs to be addressed as a multi-dimensional issue, the president of the U.N. General Assembly said here today. Speaking at a meeting observing World Food Day at the U.N. headquarters, Razali Ismail, president of the U.N. General Assembly, said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights pronounced freedom from hunger as one of the \"inalienable and inviolable rights of all members of the human family.\" However, a staggering 800 million people are chronically undernourished though the world now produces enough food for all its inhabitants, he said. On dealing with the issue, he said that the huge dimensions of hunger and food insecurity are closely linked to poverty and land tenure issues, to unsustainable production and consumption patterns, to property rights regimes that erode the diversity of genetic resources, to the impact of technology on small producers, the role of women in agrarian communities, and the multiple guises of power politics which commodify food as political and economic weapons in the globalized market place. \"The United Nations must always be on the side of equity and social justice, and protect the interests of the marginalized and the poor. To do so in the case of food security and in the pursuit of eliminating hunger would mean finding the political ways and economic means to protect the interests, rights and traditional skills of farmers and those that `cannot sleep because of hunger,'\" he said.   \n",

Ethiopian Prime Minister Tamirat Layne said today that freedom from hunger is a basic right and this right should be ensured. Layne made the remarks when he was opening a three-day workshop here on \"Famine in Ethiopia: Learning from the Past and Prepare for the Future.\" He said Ethiopia has adopted an economic development strategy to achieve self-reliance and prosperity through the proper use and development of the country's natural resources. The workshop, jointly sponsored by the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, Inter-Africa Group and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, is aimed at looking for solution proposals for fighting hunger and poverty in Ethiopia. During the past three decades, famines have hit the country almost every 10 years, killing millions of Ethiopians.   \n",

The World Bank Thursday approved a 38 million U.S. dollar loan to implement a program that aims to assure formal and sustainable rights to real property in poor settlements in Peru's urban areas. It is estimated that in these areas, 70 percent of all urban properties are not formally inscribed in the registry, denying the owners of these properties -- poorer urban dwellers -- the social and economic benefits of ownership. The loan will be used to finance the majority of the registration of 960,000 properties, of which 800,000 will be individually titled. The formalization process will cover an estimated 4 million people, about one-quarter of the total population, who live near the poverty line. The project will also improve the existing process of collecting and analyzing legal and special ownership information to support the scaling up of the formalization process.   \n",

Kofi Annan's new humanitarian forum, bringing together aid agencies, governments and the private sector, will begin its work in October, the former U.N. secretary-general said Monday. Annan said a critical part of the forum's work will be to improve cooperation among various groups helping to relieve poverty, hunger and devastation from natural disasters around the world. The \"Global Humanitarian Forum\" will be launched Oct. 17. Switzerland has given the Geneva-based project 1.3 million Swiss francs (US$1.1 million; euro800,000). Annan, the forum's president, said the first task is to look at ways to help the communities around the world that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \"Environmental change and natural disasters already displace more people than armed conflict,\" said Annan, who stepped down at the end of last year after a decade as head of the United Nations. \"We need to do more to address the needs of the most vulnerable people and communities.\"   \n",

Migrant workers are lured to Malaysia by promises of high salaries but often end up being exploited and abused, Amnesty International says in a report that urged the government to better protect foreign laborers. \"Migrant workers come to Malaysia to escape poverty and to provide for their families. Once they arrive, however, many workers toil in conditions that amount to labor exploitation,\" the London-based rights group said in a report released Wednesday. Malaysia depends heavily on foreign laborers, who make up more than a fifth of the country's work force and fill jobs at construction sites, factories, restaurants, households and palm oil plantations. But lower-than-promised wages, unsafe working conditions, and arbitrary arrests and extortion are common, said Amnesty. An Amnesty team visited Malaysia in July 2009 and interviewed more than 200 workers -- both legal and illegal -- for the 100-page report titled \"Trapped -- The Exploitation of Migrant Workers in Malaysia.\"   \n",

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Tuesday called on the world leaders to reduce hunger and poverty to achieve sustainable development. As long as millions of people are still suffering from chronic hunger and extreme poverty, there can not be sustainable development, FAO Assistant Director-General Hartwig de Haen said in a statement issued here at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). \"The poor are certainly not responsible for the bulk of resource depletion and environmental degradation. However, they suffer most from it. Poor farmers care deeply for the limited resources on which they depend,\" de Haen said. \"Due to lack of sufficient access to land, water and appropriate technologies their actions are dominated by the struggle to survive.\" More than 70 percent of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas and depend mostly on agriculture for their livelihoods.   \n",

Senior officials from 25 economies in Asia and the Pacific region concluded here today the meeting on social development in preparation for a ministerial conference on November 10-11. During the four-day meeting, the senior officials reviewed the social development situation in the region and the prospects into the next century. They agreed that poverty alleviation, employment expansion and the integration of vulnerable groups into the society remained the most daunting social problems facing the region in spite of efforts by the economies in the region. Poverty remained the prime obstacle to the social development in the region, they noted, adding despite advances in economy, the region is still home to 1.3 billion poor people, about three-fourths of the world's total poor population. Poverty reduction, employment expansion and social integration are three core issues of social development defined by the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1995.   \n",

Dozens of heads of states and governments attending the World Food Summit voiced here Monday their concerns and commitments regarding the fight against hunger. The Summit, hosted by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), convened two plenary sessions on Monday. More than 50 heads of delegations of FAO members addressed the two sessions, proposing specific measures to achieve the goal, set by the 1996 summit, of cutting the number of the hungry people by half by 2015. Romano Prodi, President of the European Union, said the overall goal of European policy is the fostering of sustainable development based on a comprehensive approach, which seeks to combine aid for developing countries with measures in cooperation and trade. Combating poverty and hunger requires a sufficient mobilization of resources and there is a need to promote sustained economic growth and enable rural and agricultural development to play a relevant role for these purposes, he said.   \n",

Trade barriers and subsidies used by the United States and Europe were blamed by Latin American officials for a failure to come to grips with the 54 million people the United Nations says are malnourished in the region. ``We can't compete with the treasury of other countries,'' Costa Rica's agriculture minister, Rodolfo Coto Pacheco, said at a U.N. hunger forum Monday at the Inter-American Development Bank. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has set of goal of cutting world hunger in half by 2015, including in Africa were 14.4 million people in six countries face starvation. In recent weeks, however, the agency has expressed doubt about its ability to reduce famine substantially, blaming in part a controversy that has arisen over genetically engineered crops from seeds produced in abundance by the United States but rejected by several African governments. But it was U.S. and European trade policies that agriculture officials from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia and other Latin American countries blamed for compounding poverty and hunger in rural areas of their countries, citing as an example a drop in export prices of coffee to 50 cents a pound.   \n",

Whether picking lettuces in California or cutting sugar cane in Brazil, agricultural workers across the world are the poorest of the rural poor, the International Labor Organization said Friday. Paid often exploitatively low wages, they face dangerous working conditions with little or no social protection in times of accident or illness. Child labor, bonded work or even forced labor is prevalent. In a new report ``Wage workers in agriculture,'' the U.N. Labor agency makes an in-depth study into the working conditions of the sector. It calls for action from the ILO's 156 member countries. ``Our basic message is you will find workers in poverty in California, in east and west Europe, in Africa and the Caribbean,'' said Philippe Egger, author of the report.   \n",

The Norwegian Government has  allocated 240 million Norwegian krones (35 million US dollars) to  a new scheme which will provide highly subsidised loans to the  world's poorest countries in time of needs, Norwegiana  Broadcasting reported on Thursday. The scheme is to deal with natural disasters, wars, or sharp  fluctuations in the prices of import or export goods in some  countries or regions, said a government press release. \"This new scheme will act as a buffer and will help to ensure  continuity in the fight against poverty, even in cases where  vulnerable, poor countries have to deal with sudden severe  economic shocks due to external circumstances,\" Norway's  International Development Minister Erik Solheim said. The fund has been established by the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), following a proposal by the G8 nations.   \n",

REPORT MAPS HUNGER `HOT SPOTS'. Hunger now afflicts 830 million people around the world because of natural disasters, armed conflict and a grinding poverty that consigns the poor to chronic malnutrition, the U.N. World Food Program reported Monday. ``From generation to generation, people don't have enough food to eat,'' Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director, said at a news briefing, where she distributed a map identifying ``hot spots'' where hunger is most severe. The map identifies large swathes of territory in sub-Sahara Africa and Asia where tens of millions of people, most of them women and children, cannot get enough to eat. ``The combination of poverty and disaster causes people to have even less possibility to build resources to end their hunger,'' Bertini said. The World Food Program defines hunger as a condition in which people fail to get enough food to provide the nutrients for active, healthy lives. Those who are considered undernourished subsist on 1,800 calories a day or less. The figure of 2,100 is generally recommended to sustain an average adult. Although the data the program uses was collected for the period 1995-1997, officials said that their research shows that the scope of the problem has not improved, and in some places is getting worse.   \n",

An anti-hunger organization said Thursday it hopes the summit of the Group of 20 largest economies will deliver clear signals on addressing world hunger on a grass-roots basis. John Coonrod, vice president of The Hunger Project, a New York-based international nongovernmental organization, said he is looking for the G20 leaders to \"recognize that women are the key to end hunger.\" The world needs \"a new political pressure to ensure food supplies are available,\" Coonrod said in an interview on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Pittsburgh Thursday and Friday. Eight percent of hunger is related to emergencies and 92 percent to poverty that should be tackled by investing in grass-roots agricultural development in poor countries, where women are responsible for most of the farming, he said. Coonrod welcomed the G20's coordination of a response to the global financial and economic crisis that has shown political will between rich and emerging economies, such as China and India.   \n",

A high-level meeting on the impacts of the global economic slowdown on poverty and sustainable development in the Asia and Pacific region opened here on Monday. The conference is organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in collaboration with Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development of China, and the Secretariat of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It has attracted about 350 delegates from 28 countries and regions in Asia and the Pacific, 25 development agencies and embassies, and 13 non-governmental organizations. Delivering a speech at the opening ceremony, Standing Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Sinh Hung said that Vietnam always considers rural development and poverty reduction as an important pillar in the country's strategy on economic growth and sustainable development.

The G20 Seoul Summit has endorsed Multi-Year Action Plan on Development over the medium term with deadlines from next year to late 2014, according to the joint communique issued on Friday afternoon after the end of the summit. The G20 countries said as the crisis disproportionately affected the most vulnerable in the poorest countries and slowed progress toward achievement of the Millenium Development Goals ( MDGs), they recognize the need to strengthen and leverage develop efforts to address such challenges. The plan includes actions on infrastructure, human resources and development, private investment and job creation, food security, growth resilience, financial inclusion and domestic resource mobilization, and knowledge sharing. According to the plan, there are altogether 16 actions under the seven categories. The G20 countries will work with regional and international organizations, such as World Bank, and UNESCO and WTO, to realize the targets. There are some core principles on which the plan was based, said the communiqu.An enduring and meaningful poverty reduction can not be achieved without inclusive, sustainable and resilient growth. Partnership should be established among developing countries and priority should be put on global or regional systematic issues that call for collective action.   \n",

Vietnam is intensifying its efforts on hunger alleviation and poverty reduction by striving to help some 300,000 poor households escape hunger this year. Vietnam has planned to reduce the rate of poverty-stricken households nationwide to 13.7 percent this year, Vietnam News Agency Saturday quoted Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs as saying. Vietnam now has 2.4 million households classified as poor, accounting for 15.7 percent of the total population. There are almost 1,500 poor communes nationwide each with more than 40 percent of their households classified as in poverty. Hunger and poverty eradication has been set as a major policy and an important undertaking by the Vietnamese government. The hunger alleviation and poverty reduction program started in 1992. The Vietnamese government planned to allocate 900 billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (64.3 million U.S. dollars) to the national program on hunger elimination and poverty reduction this year with 70 percent being channeled to the 1,000 poorest communes nationwide.   \n",

Man-made disasters and natural hazards such as armed conflicts, floods, drought, famine, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions cost Africa 15 billion US dollars last year, according to a WHO meeting closed here on Friday. The find is contained in a paper prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa for review at a roundtable of African health and development experts and officials, which was held on the sidelines of the 53rd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa taking place on Sept. 1-5 here. \"The recurring humanitarian crises within the African Region erodes decades of development achievement, further entrenching poverty and inequality,\" the paper said, illustrating the point with the recent earthquake in Algeria which clamed 2,300 lives, left 15,000 people injured, and caused financial losses estimated at 5 billion dollars. Another \"striking\" illustration of the consequences of disasters in the region is the floods which ravaged Mozambique in 2000, causing losses of more than 427 million dollars. Recent and ongoing emergencies in the region have caused millions of deaths and incalculable human suffering in Africa.   \n",

Hundreds of Zambians from civil  society organizations marched through the capital Friday, urging  the world's rich nations to act on promises to help African  countries get out of poverty. The march, coming ahead of the Group 8 club of industrial  nations meeting in Britain next week, is part of a global call for action against poverty, debt and trade injustice demanded by poor  nations. The demonstrators, carrying placards and singing anti-slavery  songs, marched along Cairo road in the city center to the freedom  statue where speeches were made. One placard said \"G-8 nations,  you promise act now!\" \"We are calling on rich nations to act on their promises so  that we can move out of poverty. The rich nations should be told  that debt is a form of slavery and should be fought the same way  human slavery was fought,\" John Phiri from Global Justice Zambia  told the demonstrators. He said Africa will not meet the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs) if rich nations do not open up markets and increase official development assistance to the continent.   \n",

A scheme to integrate family planning work with aid-the-poor projects is expected to speed up birth control in the backward rural areas. The State Family Planning Commission (SFPC) is now striving to combine birth-control work with economic development, with the object of helping farmers get rich and at the same time promote cultural progress in the countryside. The new approach, first carried out in northeast China's Jilin Province, has been praised by Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister in charge of the SFPC, as a \"road of hope for rural family planning\". At a meeting held at the end of 1994 in Sichuan, the most populous province in China, the approach won support from family planning officials from throughout the country, and a decision was made to carry it out nationwide as a basic principle for the current and future population-control work. Senior SFPC officials said that they believed that the new principle will be helpful for breaking out of the vicious circle of \"poverty-more children-poverty\" and for triggering a revolution in people's attitudes towards birth control through economic development.   \n",

Brazil's new president Fernando Henrique Cardoso has promised to fight poverty with ambitious economic reforms but must first conquer the government budget deficit, experts say. When Cardoso took office Sunday, the 1995 government budget included a deficit of more than 10 billion dollars, equal to almost two percent of the country's gross domestic product. To narrow the budget gap, Cardoso will have to fend off enormous pressure to spend more on social welfare and health programs, experts say. That balancing act will be precarious, they say, because Cardoso has vowed to help the poor masses, even if it means the powerful rich minority will suffer. Cardoso hopes his plans will be boosted by a free trade pact with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that went into effect on Sunday. Mercosur, as the pact is known, combines 200 million consumers with a gross domestic product of 800 billion dollars.\", 'AFP_ENG_19950106.0026': '(picture) Singapore PM urges India to strengthen reforms by Abhik Kumar Chanda. Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged India on Friday to pursue and strengthen its free-market reforms to help eliminate poverty and become a \"leading economic powerhouse.\" \"India will join the Asian newly industrialised economies, China and Southeast Asia if the bold reforms are followed through,\" Goh said in his keynote address on the last day of an international business conference here. The Singapore premier, the chief guest at the three-day conference marking the centenary of the country\\'s oldest trade body, the Confederation of Indian Industry, said India had no alternative but to liberalise. \"Economic deregulation is a necessity if you are to avoid being left behind in the new world order,\" he said. \"There is no other credible option if India is to relieve itself of poverty.\" Goh said the focus of global economic activity was shifting to Asia and the region would overthrow Western dominance in the next century.', 'AFP_ENG_19950108.0007': 'Vietnam prime minister pledges more openness for Catholics. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has offered to improve conditions for Roman Catholic worshippers in a move seen as a new olive branch to the church. Kiet said the communist government would create \"more conditions\" for Catholics to practice their faith and \"contribute more to the national development to help the country get out of poverty\".  He made the remarks at a meeting with the Archbishop of Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Van Binh, the Vietnam News Agency said Sunday. The meeting in the southern commercial hub comes amid a slow easing of constraints on the Catholic church which has long been held in suspicion by the authorities. But even Kiet\\'s offer is not expected to ease official restrictions. Vietnam insists that all religions come under state control, a point firmly resisted by the Vatican. Even under the more liberal controls of recent years, few churches are allowed to hold mass, sermons are controlled and only a handful of priests are permitted to work. The archbishop and the prime minister discussed the government\\'s new attitude towards the church and the role of Catholics in the country\\'s economic reform programme, VNA said.', 'AFP_ENG_19950111.0251': 'Rich countries unenthused by UN social summit in Copenhagen. An unprecedented United Nations social summit aimed at tackling world poverty and unemployment has failed to ignite the interest of rich nations being counted on for their support, top UN officials said here Wednesday. Although more than 70 heads of state or government have said they will attend the Copenhagen summit from March 6 to 12, only one of the seven richest -- France -- was among them, they told a press briefing. The other leading industrial nations -- Germany, Canada, the United States, Britain, Italy and Japan -- \"until now have shown little initiative of important substance,\" said UN under secretary-general Ismat Kittani. The lack of interest threatened to transform the conference into another North-South dialogue of the deaf, observers said. Among leaders having promised to attend, he said, were presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Nelson Mandela of South Africa.', 'AFP_ENG_19950112.0003': 'Police free 231 Chinese women kidnapped for sale to peasants.

The agenda for a UN anti-poverty summit next March has big goals and a controversial agenda: lifting one billion people out of poverty, creating 800 million jobs and increasing social spending. A total of 180 countries on Monday began the last preparatory meeting before the Copenhagen summit March 6-12. Delegations hope to put the finishing touches on a statement for the heads of state and government to sign. There are the usual points of friction: where will the money come from and exactly what to do with it. Nations define social development differently, and rich and poor nations tend not to agree on how to get there. Eradicating poverty and creating massive numbers of jobs are not the only challenges laid out in the text. It also touches on such politically sensitive topics as cutting defense budgets to finance social spending, foreign aid pledges for poor countries, the end of discrimination against women and slowing population growth.', 'AFP_ENG_19950117.0313': 'UN chief regrets hands tied in Chechnya. UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed regret Tuesday that the United Nations could not act to try to halt the bloodshed in Chechnya. \"It is a tragic situation, but the UN can\\'t intervene in Chechnya. We can\\'t intervene in internal affairs of a sovereign state unless Russia asks us to mediate,\" Boutros-Ghali said of the breakaway republic where Russian troops have been fighting separatists for the past five weeks. The UN chief, speaking at the end of a three-day visit to Denmark, rejected the idea of putting priority on some conflicts at the expense of others as a way to reduce the world body\\'s current budget deficit estimated at 1.8 billion dollars. \"If two or three member states ask us to intervene anywhere in world, we will do so,\" he said.

Mexican rebels have extended a ceasefire that was to have expired on Wednesday for an indefinite period, they said in a statement released here on Tuesday. The Zapatista National Liberation Army said it had extended the truce so as not to bog down negotiations which resumed here Sunday after a 10-month break. The interior ministry described those talks as \"positive.\" The Zapatistas, dominated by peasants and local Indians, launched a January 1, 1994 uprising in the southern state of Chiapas to demand relief from poverty among other issues. A ceasefire was declared on January 13, 1994 after some 150 people were killed. The last round of direct peace talks in Chiapas were held in early March but the Zapatistas formally broke off the talks in June.', 'AFP_ENG_19950119.0195': 'Marcos\\' son pleads poverty after US jury decision. The son of ousted president Ferinand Marcos said Thursday his family did not have the money to pay torture victims during his father\\'s rule, after a US jury awarded 766.4 million dollars in damages to the plaintiffs. A Honolulu court on Wednesday ruled that the Marcos estate should pay the amount in \"compensatory damages\" to 9,070 victims of human rights abuses during Marcos\\' rule. The victims filed a class action suit in the United States. Congressman Ferdinand Marcos Junior said he had read reports about the jury decision, but said he did not know where the family could get the money, claiming that all Marcos\\' assets have been frozen or taken away. \"As for the legal implications, I will have to consult our counsel,\" said the late president\\'s only son, who announced he would run for the senate in the May elections.

Luxury European car maker BMW has taken the costly pole position in a race to dominate one of the world's smallest prestige auto markets, but believes the long, lonely wait for profits will pay off. The German firm has pumped millions of dollars into its dream of producing and selling its famous status symbols in Vietnam, one of the Asia's poorest countries where most people could not even afford the fuel to run the cars. With their showroom price-tag of 65,000 dollars, owning one of the 24 BMW 525i cars that slid out of their factory on Tuesday will remain just a distant fantasy for most Vietnamese who have an average per capita income of only 200 dollars per month. But despite the poverty in a country where by far the most common form of transport remains the push bike, BMW and its local partner Vietnam Motor Corporation (VMC) plan to sell at least 200 of the sleek vehicles in 1995 and even double that number next year. The 79-year-old firm plans to use its reputation as the maker of one of Asia's favourite symbols of success in order to carve out a market for itself in Vietnam, where a wealthy elite of entrepreneurs is already emerging.\", 'AFP_ENG_19950125.0267': \"Tutu to host conference of Nobel laureates.

The parliamentarians were to view CIS border positions near the town of Gali before departing to Tbilisi on Friday for meetings with the Georgian side.

A month-old Russian move to seal its border with Abkhazia has driven this break-away region of Georgia, once a glamorous strip of subtropical Black Sea resorts, deeper into poverty and lawlessness. Abkhazia declared its independence from Georgia in 1992 and defeated Georgian forces in a year-long war which reduced the region to a string of ghost towns. Virtually the entire Georgian population -- nearly half the local population -- was driven out. Georgia maintains that 300,000 refugees fled the region. Abkhazia's border with Georgia is sealed off and patrolled by Russian troops. But Abkhazia sank deeper into isolation on December 20 when the border with Russia was also closed. Local traders believe the border was closed to stop Abkhazians making their way to Chechnya to fight on the side of secessionist rebels against Russian forces there.\", 'AFP_ENG_19950128.0153': 'WHO to concentrate on the expanding \"pockets of poverty\". In the face of growing poverty, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is to focus its efforts more closely on the planet\\'s poorest inhabitants, a spokeswoman for the organisation said Saturday. Speaking at the end of a two-week meeting of the WHO\\'s executive committee Friday, Claire Chollat-Traquet, spokeswoman for the organisation\\'s Director General Hiroshi Nakajima, told journalists the WHO would henceforth \"concentrate more on (alleviating) poverty and marginalisation.\" Observers said the change of strategy marked a radical departure from the WHO\\'s stated aim of ensuring \"Health for all by the year 2000.\" Chollat-Traquet said monitored rises in life expectancy and falls in infant mortality indictated positive developments.

Some 10,000 people gathered outside Saint Petersburg\\'s Winter Palace on Saturday to protest against rising poverty, laying the blame on Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Demonstrators marched on the city centre at the instigation of pro- communist movements to mark the 51st anniversary of the lifting of the wartime Nazi siege of Leningrad, as the city was then called. \"What Hitler did not succeed in doing Gorbachev and Yeltsin have managed,\" shouted many marchers. Pro-communist groups have never accepted the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991, nor the renaming of the city under its pre-Bolshevik name.

Delegates from 184 countries finished setting the stage Saturday for the world summit on poverty and social development in Copenhagen in March.

Like previous conferences in New York on children in 1990, the Rio conference on the environment in 1992 and the Cairo conference on population in 1994, this summit is not expected to produce any immediate concrete results, nor any binding resolutions. But, Copenhagen will more than anything point the way toward long-term global action and will air the opinions of the states on the subject. If such a summit puts poverty on the world's negotiating table for the first time, it is because it is an urgent political issue in all the states, rich and poor, and because the Cold War is over, according to most delegates to the preparatory meeting January 16 to 28 in New York.\", 'AFP_ENG_19950131.0328': 'Tokyo evaluates Manila\\'s 1.35-billion-dollar aid request.

The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said the mission would determine whether the projects qualified for funding under Japan\\'s regular Yen Credit packages to this country. They range from highway rehabilitation, improvement in power grids, urban development, modernization of air navigation and maritime safety, upgrading of rural water supplies and infrastructure to support agrarian reform projets. The mission was dispatched following suggestions by Tokyo that Manila include more \"poverty alleviation\" projects in the list to be covered by OECF funding.
