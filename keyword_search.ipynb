      "Mugabe outlines \"new vision for Africa\" by Lawrence Bartlett. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe outlined a \"new vision for Africa\" Thursday, in which the continent would no longer be synonymous with economic mismanagement, civil strife, or human rights abuses, nor with poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease. Opening a meeting of African presidents and representatives of Western donor nations he said that \"perhaps at no other time in Africa's history has the continent felt so acutely the need for partnership and genuine friendship than today.\" Africa \"is an essential component of the global polity. The failure or success of Africa affects the rest of the world, for the world is one,\" he said. \"Global peace, economic prosperity and environmental regeneration cannot be sustained unless Africa is freed from the vicissitudes of poverty and war.\" Mugabe said the troubled continent was embarking on a three-pronged programme of economic structural adjustment, political reforms and regional integration and was committed to \"take charge of its own development and to learn the lessons of the past.\" He said good governance had become accepted as vital throughout Africa as \"democracy cannot be complete without it\".\n",

      "French intervention raises hope despite misgivings by David Chazan. The French military intervention in Rwanda launched Thursday raised some hope of an end to genocide despite African misgivings and hostility from rebels as the country teeters on the brink of mass starvation. After a 10-week bloodbath that has cost up to half a million lives and left Rwanda threatened with famine, diplomats and aid workers expressed cautious optimism that the 2,500-strong French force would succeed in rescuing thousands of Tutsis from Hutu militias blamed for much of the bloodshed. Up to half a million Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, have been butchered as the predominantly Tutsi rebels have advanced against beleaguered government forces. With fewer than 500 troops in Rwanda, UN commander Romeo Dallaire has repeatedly complained that his men have been powerless to save civilians from being hacked to death by extremist militiamen. \"The French forces are going into the government-controlled eastern parts of Rwanda where they can certainly do something to save several thousand Tutsis stranded behind enemy lines,\" said a western diplomat familiar with Rwanda.\n",

      "Too many aid agencies in Mozambique: minister. Poverty-stricken Mozambique has uncritically accepted all international aid offers, regardless of whether they respect the government's authority and development goals, the deputy cooperation minister said Wednesday. \"The government has been too permissive, we have acted like a wet sponge soaking up everything without being sufficiently selective, critical or demanding,\" Oldimiro Baloi told a seminar here on the co- ordination of international aid in Mozambique. As a result, many of over 200 humanitarian non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in Mozambique virtually ignored the existence of the authorities while failing to co-ordinate among themselves, Baloi said. Mozambique has become dependent on many foreign workers while its own capacity to act is often undermined, the minister argued. \"Most of these organisations speak of coordination without ever doing it. They apparently prefer to ignore the government so long as we let them pursue their own objectives, while the government is unable to control or duly evaluate their work,\" Baloyi said.\n",

An Iranian charity organisation is providing help to almost 22,000 poor Lebanese including those made homeless by Israeli attacks on south Lebanon, the Iranian news agency IRNA said Sunday. Ali Zarigh, head of the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation's Lebanon branch, told IRNA that the charity had been active in Lebanon for seven years and spent about 5.5 million dollars on aiding the poor. The foundation has also been helping people displaced by Israeli attacks on Lebanon and victims of natural disasters -- both Moslems and non-Moslems, he said. Zarigh added that the foundation had helped to put 3,000 orphans through school, and had built five schools as well as seven special education centers for retarded children in various parts of the country. The foundation was created after the 1979 Islamic revolution as part of a drive to help the world's \"oppressed.\"\n",

      "Aid workers evacuated as \"bandits\" take over refugee camp by Lawrence Bartlett. Eighty foreign aid workers were evacuated Friday after their lives were threatened by \"bandits\" who have taken control of a Rwandan refugee camp in Zaire, the UNHCR said. Some of the 80 international staff working in Katale camp were moving north towards the Ugandan border, while those in the southern sector of the sprawling settlement were returning to Goma, spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees told AFP. The UNHCR has called on the Zairean authorities to help restore order in the camp, home to 270,000 refugees, where two people have been killed in factional violence in the past two days. \"We believe the threats were serious enough to put aid workers' lives in danger,\" Sachs said. \"But we want to get back into the camp as soon as possible to continue caring for the vulnerable -- the elderly, women and children.\" The UNHCR would give no details of who the \"bandits\" in Katale camp were, but Western observers here believe they are members of the mainly-Hutu militias responsible for massacres of Tutsis in Rwanda earlier this year.\n",

      "UN troops wound refugees attacking aid workers. Polish UN troops serving in Croatia opened fire on a group of several hundred Bosnian Moslem refugees and wounded two of them after they started attacking UN aid workers, a UN official said Sunday. One of the refugees was seriously hurt in the incident, which happened late Saturday, Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Zagreb said. Kessler said four UNHCR aid workers were distributing leaflets to refugees at Turanj, a small town controlled by secessionist Serbs, encouraging the refugees to return to their homes in the Bihac pocket of north-west Bosnia, when they were attacked. The UNHCR offered in the leaflets to guarantee the safety of the refugees who fled Bihac after Bosnian government troops took the area formerly controlled by maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic. Convinced by their leaders that they would be in danger if they returned home, the refugees insist they want to remain at Turanj despite the poor conditions they are living in and the certainty that these will worsen with the arrival of winter.\n",

Around 80 foreign aid workers were evacuated from Katale, home to more than a quarter of a million Rwandan refugees, after their lives were threatened on Friday. \"All of us are very hopeful that we will have a quick resolution to this problem because it's now four days since we have been in the camp,\" Sachs said. \"We are very concerned about what it means for the vulnerable -- the women, the children and the elderly.\"\n",

In an address to the National Association of Realtors, the president said that home ownership had been sliding since 1980. \"We have to turn this around ... and I am convinced that we can do it,\" he said, saying his goal was to bring home ownership to \"an all time high in the US before the century is over.\" To accomplish this, Clinton said he had asked Henry Cisneros, the secretary of housing and urban development, to create a task force that drew on such diverse groups as real estate agents, mortgage bankers, urban development experts and anti-poverty workers.

Japan assumed the chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Saturday, vowing to focus on development cooperation in the lead-up to next year's ministerial meeting in Osaka. Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, speaking at the end of the sixth APEC ministerial meeting, said development cooperation and liberalising trade and investment were \"two wheels on the same axle\" for the 18-member group. Brandishing a gavel handed to him by this year's chairman, Indonesian Coordinating Trade and Industry Minister Hartarto, he said Japan -- the world's biggest aid donor -- wanted to move beyond \"traditional one-sided\" aid from rich to poor countries. Kono called instead for a \"network\" taking advantage of each member's strengths, including mutual assistance between developing countries. \"I intend to submit a specific plan as soon as possible,\" he said. A joint statement adopted at the end of the two-day meeting said ministers welcomed a Japanese \"partners-for-progress\" proposal to strengthen the ability of members to mobilise human and other resources.\n",

The military-backed government of Sudan Tuesday rejected charges by the United Nations that it engaged in widescale human rights abuses, including systematic torture and extrajudicial executions. Foreign Minister Hussein Abu Saleh said the report, prepared by UN special rapporteur Gaspar Biro, was based on false information supplied by the opposition. \"Biro's report is contrary to reality,\" he told a press conference. The study released last week said both the government, which controls the north of the country, and Sudanese rebels in the south were responsible for human rights abuses. Besides torture and executions, it cited widescale arbitrary arrests of people suspected of opposing the regime. Biro said Sudan had refused to allow him entry into the country so his study was based on interviews with Sudanese refugees, UN aid officials and non-governmental relief workers in Uganda, Kenya and Egypt.\n",

More than 800 Rwandan refugees have been escorted back home in recent days by UN aid workers, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said in Geneva Tuesday. Sylvana Foa said that though the number of those returning was small and though the situation in Rwanda \"was by no means perfect, we see a lot of positive developments\". Among these she cited the deployment of troops belonging to the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) and of human rights observers from the United Nations and organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross who were getting \"full access\" to areas where people were returning. An estimated two million Rwandans, almost all Hutus, fled the country after the victory of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front in a civil war during which up to a million people were butchered, mainly minority Tutsis by Hutu extremists. \"The Kigali government with a total lack of resources is doing what it can to improve security, is making a big effort to put a civilian administration in place, is warning against retaliations,\" Foa said.\n",

Commenting on the DAC's annual report, highlighting a marked decline from 1993 in official development assistance (ODA) from industrial donor countries, Michel said, \"what we stress is that there is a shared interest in global human security\" -- security from fear and security from need -- that \"could be a unifying force.\" \"The well-being of (our) people depends on the well-being of poor countries as well,\" he added.\n",

      "UN Social Summit faces criticism it will achieve little by Michael Adler. The first UN social development summit moved toward finalizing its key document Thursday amid criticism that the gathering will achieve little and probably worsen the plight of the poor. The 184-nation UN Summit for Social Development was expected to approve late Thursday night a final draft on the main themes of fighting poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. Approval of the document by 115 heads of state and government next weekend will end a long process of defining goals and programs that began when the UN General Assembly called in 1992 for a social summit to be convened. Non-governmental aid workers, however, on Thursday assailed the summit as ineffective, out-of-touch with the people of the world and likely to further impoverish the poor. African representatives said they were afraid they would go home empty-handed. Debate has focused on such issues as calls to match the World Bank and IMF's financial austerity conditions with socially oriented measures for developing nations; and a proposal for developed nations to allocate 20 percent of official aid to social programs while developing states earmark 20 percent of their budgets for the same ends.\n",

President Bill Clinton said Wednesday he was vetoing legislation to cut 16.4 billion dollars in federal spending this year, in his first use of his presidential veto power. \"I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that cuts education to save pet congressional projects,\" Clinton said at a White House ceremony. The bill contains three measures for which Clinton has pushed steadily: 6.7 billion dollars in emergency aid to states struck by natural disasters; 275 million dollars to cancel Jordan's debt; and 250 million dollars in aid to Oklahoma City, where a bomb attack killed 168 people in April. It also includes social spending for programs dear to Clinton including some educational ones. Clinton told Republican, who control Congress, to pass a new package that would protect social spending and eliminate cuts from other previously approved projects, such as for roads and courthouses.\n",

Aidid said famine had claimed the lives of many people in the regions of Lower Jubba in the south, the central province of Galgudud and the northern regions of the country. He said several people had died of diseases related to malnutrition and poor sanitation in Mogadishu. On Friday, the French humanitarian organisation International Action Against Famine (AICF) said 25 percent of the youngest children in Mogadishu are starving and in need of immediate food aid and the situation continued to deteriorate. Aidid said humanitarian work in Somalia would be coordinated by the internal affairs ministry of a \"government\" he formed last month after his supporters elected him \"interim president\".

Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid vastly extended his power base with the capture of Baidoa at the weekend, as observers predicted Monday he would move on to the southern port city of Kismayo and renewed civil war loomed over the country. As his 600-strong militia force in Baidoa celebrated Sunday's victory, General Aidid's main rival warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed threatened Monday to declare \"all-out war\" against his arch-enemy, raising fears of more large-scale bloodletting and famine in the ravaged Horn of Africa country. Ali Mahdi gave Aidid 24 hours to withdraw his forces from the inland town and warned the general that he would be responsible for the ensuing \"catastrophe\" if he tried to extend his control beyond southern Mogadishu. Details of Aidid's onslaught on Baidoa were flimsy as his militiamen ripped out short-wave radio equipment. However, 17 expatriate aid workers seized in the offensive were said to be safe. According to relief workers in Nairobi, the general led a column which included 30 \"technicals\" -- pickup trucks mounted with heavy weapons -- from his south Mogadishu stronghold to Baidoa, some 250 kilometres (150 miles) away, in the middle of the night.\n",

Dubbed ReliefWeb, it will enable UN agencies, governments and international aid organisations to keep track of the development of crises and see who is taking action and the extent of their resources. The UN's Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DAH) showed off ReliefWeb at the humanitarian WorldAid forum taking place here this week. The United Nations asked the DAH in 1994 to develop a network to improve communication and planning for emergency intervention by the various agencies and groups. Updated daily, ReliefWeb will centralise information and data with the aim of increasing efficiency at a time when the United Nations is facing financial problems and criticism for its bureacracy and slowness to react.\n",

      "Developed countries' poor suffer from food shortages: FAO. More and more people in developed countries lack adequate food as a result of their governments' economic policies, the Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in a report published here. In developing nations, meanwhile, some 841 million people, or 20 percent of the population, are affected by hunger, the UN body said ahead of a world food summit to be held next month. South Asia, especially India and Bangladesh, and sub-Saharan Africa, notably where armed conflicts are taking place, are particularly affected, the FAO said. In industrialised states, the report noted, the need for food aid had grown among lower income groups as the gap between rich and poor widened in the 1980's and '90's, welfare benefits were cut and unemployment increased. Homeless people were particularly vulnerable in this respect, the FAO said.\n",

Only 10 of the 45 sub-saharan African countries are on target to achieve eight development goals endorsed by world leaders two years ago, including halving poverty and hunger, a new UN report said on Wednesday. Prepared at the request of the G8 summit of world leaders which has opened in the Canadian Rockies, the report has been drawn up by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Children's Fund UNICEF. It warns that nearly half Africa's population, or about 300 million people, live on less than one dollar a day and that the number is rising. The figure jumped 25 percent between 1990 and 1999. \"If current trends continue, Africa will be the only region where the number of poor people in 2015 will be higher than in 1990,\" the report said. Africa's share of global trade stood at about five percent in the 1980s but dipped below three percent the following decade, while growth in exports of manufactured goods also dramatically fell.\n",

But the Rome-based relief agency's campaign for North Korea has suffered setbacks amid a standoff over the North's nuclear weapons drive. North Korea has suffered from chronic food shortages after years of natural disasters and its failed centralized economic policy.\n",

Bush on Wednesday scolded allies there on aid to poor nations, notably accusing them of hindering efforts to fight famine in Africa. Bush, who will see leading critics of the war in Iraq when the world's wealthiest nations and Russia meet in France June 1-3, said the European ban on genetically modified foods was an obstacle to battling widespread starvation. \"Our partners in Europe are impeding this effort. They have blocked all new biocrops because of unfounded, unscientific fears,\" he said in a graduation-day speech to the US Coast Guard Academy. \"This has caused many African nations to avoid investing in biotechnologies, for fear that their products will be shut out of European markets. European governments should join -- not hinder -- the great cause of ending hunger in Africa,\" he said. Supporters of biotechnology say it helps farmers increase yields, lower pesticide use, improve soil conservation and water pollution and help reduce hunger and poverty.\n",

Bush, on the defensive a year ago over meager US foreign aid, may turn the tables on his Group of Eight partners before the June summit in France. On Wednesday, he accused Europeans of stalling African famine relief by hindering the development of genetically modified foodstuffs and by punishing poor countries with high agricultural subsidies. He has also challenged them to match US contributions to the battle against AIDS. The turnaround is spectacular, when compared with the international development conference in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. Bush found himself pilloried over the relatively small amount of US aid compared with European contributions as a percentage of gross national product. \"He is really trying to press what he sees as his advantage at the moment, going to the G8 pushing the Europeans and the Japanese on a number of issues,\" said Steve Radelet, an expert at Washington's Center for Global Development. \"He has made two very significant proposals: the Millennium Challenge Account and the emergency plan for HIV-AIDS.\n",

While addicts sharing needles pass the disease around cities, many of the million migrant Tajiks who bring money home from Russia each autumn also bring HIV contracted from commercial sex workers to the rural areas where they mostly live. \"My girlfriend started selling heroin, then we both got hooked -- after a day the needle we use is passed on to clients,\" said Ruslan, a 32-year-old resident of the Tajik capital Dushanbe.

Khartoum's response was to unleash the Arab Janjaweed, who have been blamed by Western officials and aid workers for killings, rape and widespread violations of human rights. More than 70,000 people have been killed or have died from hunger and disease in the area, according to the United Nations, which calls it the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Another 1.5 million people have been displaced. On Wednesday, SLM London-based spokesman Mahjoub Hussein said the group considered truce deals signed with Khartoum null and void, warning that it would resume fighting and seek to oust the government.\n",

      "(UPDATES with 10 soldiers killed). Ten soldiers died in fresh clashes in Nepal Sunday bringing the number of dead to at least 141 in one of the kingdom's most violent weeks in the past six months, an army source said. Police casualty figures showed 98 Maoists, 39 soldiers and four policemen were killed in separate clashes since December 12. The increasing death toll comes after warnings by observers that human rights are deteriorating in the poverty-stricken Hindu kingdom. International human rights organisations this week issued fresh warnings about a deteriorating security situation for development and human rights workers as well as ordinary Nepalis. The fresh deaths occurred Sunday morning when the Maoist 14th Special Task Force attacked security forces east of the capital.\n",

President Gloria Arroyo on Tuesday called for increased vigilance in the Philippines after a huge Indian Ocean tidal wave claimed tens of thousands of lives across the region. \"We pray that it will never happen to our country, but we must be prepared. We must modernize our forecasting systems and link these up with international warning networks,\" she said in a statement. The Philippines embassy in Bangkok has been officially notified that up to eight Filipinos working in the southern Thai island resort of Phuket may have died in the tsunami that struck on Sunday, the foreign department said. Arroyo is sending teams of aid workers to some of the Philippines' neighbors affected by the catastrophe.

Nepal has unveiled far-reaching  proposals aimed at bringing education, health, water, roads and  agricultural development to the rural poor, state media said  Tuesday, a week after the king seized power. The plan comes after the new government, appointed last week by  King Gyanendra, announced a crackdown on corruption and poverty  apparently aimed at winning popular support for the monarch's  takeover of power. Maoist rebels, who according to analysts control up to 20 of  Nepal's 75 districts and have considerable influence in the others,  have won support from subsistence farmers aggrieved at seeing the  country's resources being diverted to the urban elite. The Ministry of Local Development has drafted a 39-point \"action  plan\" to improve local government across the country, state-run  radio said. Education, health, development of local resources, veterinary  services and agriculture would be developed and decentralised, it  said.\n",

In a joint statement received here, the Human Rights Watch and  Human Rights First urged Indonesia to reduce its military  involvement in the relocation of some 400,000 people in Aceh  displaced by the December 26 tsunamis. They noted Indonesia has plans to move some 100,000 people as  early as February 15 from camps to semi-permanent, barracks-style  shelters, where they will stay for up to two years while homes are  being rebuilt. But given its poor human rights record in Aceh, the groups  feared the new camps could be misused \"as a way of controlling the  population for military purposes unless human rights safeguards are  put in place\". The military's prominent role in transporting the Acehnese to  the new sites, in camp management and in aid distribution will  invariably create fears among the displaced population, they said.\n",

Only Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Sierra Leone in  Africa are more impoverished, the survey found. Afghanistan's life  expectancy is only 44.5 years, at least 20 years lower than  neighbouring central Asian nations. Officials have never before been able to carry out a proper  assessment of Afghanistan's economy, society and education because  decades of warfare made it unsafe for them. \"The basic human needs and the genuine grievances of people --  the lack of jobs, health, education, income, dignity and  opportunities for participation for the Afghan people -- must be  met, and international aid must be tightly controlled,\" the report  said.\n",

But luckily for him, it is impossible to  count the number of victims of that policy of the church in the way  that it is possible to tally the human loss brought on by other  leaders,\" Urban wrote. The late pope \"did not incite his flock to reflect and he never  said anything original or interesting, to wit his testament.\" Poland's \"total mourning\" for the pope was likened by Urban to  the period of bereavement imposed on the communist bloc by the  Soviet authorities after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, he  said.\n",

Kenya on Friday stepped up  criticism of international creditors for refusing to offer it relief  from its foreign debt as the east African nation battles a  disastrous drought that it said would badly hinder development  efforts. Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said Kenya's continued exclusion  from debt cancellation deals granted to other poor countries was  unfair and keeping the government from achieving the UN-backed  Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) which aim to halve global poverty  by 2015. \"A number of factors including recurrent drought and heavy debt  burden ... militate against our efforts to press on with the MDG  agenda,\" he told foreign diplomats at a reception late Thursday, a  transcript of which was released by the foreign ministry on Friday. Kenya along with other countries across east Africa is currently  facing a searing drought that threatens up to four million people  with starvation and has forced the re-allocation of resources for  the relief effort, something Tuju said should be factored into  creditors' calculations. \"In order to remain credit-worthy and maintain the dignity of  our land we continue to pay our debts come floods, drought or  famine,\" he said, noting that in 2005 Kenya had paid some 195  million dollars (160 million euros) to service its debt.\n",

Mohammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi  \"banker to the poor\" who won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, is  celebrated for pioneering small loans to the destitute of Bangladesh  -- a lending formula now used round the world. The economics professor began fighting poverty during a  devastating famine in Bangladesh, setting up the tiny Grameen Bank  in 1976 to provide access to credit to people too poor qualify for  traditional bank loans. The success of Grameen has now been emulated in more than 40  countries. \"You are endorsing a dream to achieve a poverty-free world,\" a  delighted  Yunus told Norway's NRK public television by telephone  after being informed he and the Grameen Bank had won the prize. His \"microcredit\" scheme gives entrepreneurs very small sums to  start up their own enterprises. It reversed conventional banking by  not obliging borrowers to offer collateral for a loan.\n",

      "Text of the Nobel Peace Prize statement. The following is the full text of  the Norwegian Nobel Committee's announcement of the Nobel Peace  Prize to Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh and his Grameen Bank, which  offers loans to poor people without any financial security: \"The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel  Peace Prize for 2006, divided into two equal parts, to Muhammad  Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and  social development from below. Lasting peace can not be achieved  unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of  poverty. Micro-credit is one such means. Development from below also  serves to advance democracy and human rights. \"Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed  to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of  millions of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other  countries. Loans to poor people without any financial security had  appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three  decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank,  developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the  struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas  and models for the many institutions in the field of micro-credit  that have sprung up around the world. \"Every single individual on earth has both the potential and the  right to live a decent life. Across cultures and civilizations,  Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor  can work to bring about their own development. \"Micro-credit has proved to be an important liberating force in  societies where women in particular have to struggle against  repressive social and economic conditions. Economic growth and  political democracy can not achieve their full potential unless the  female half of humanity participates on an equal footing with the  male.\n",

He also wants Ecuador to distance itself from communist Cuba and  from Venezuela, whose virulently anti-US president, Hugo Chavez,  favors his leftist rival Rafael Correa.

In 2007, the rate of female labour activity reached 52.5 percent against 78.8 percent for men, the ILO said. Unemployment stood at 6.4 percent for women and 5.7 percent for men. The activity rate figure was down slightly from 52.9 percent recorded a decade ago in 1997, which the ILO explained by higher female participation in education.\n",

In December, annual food inflation in Bangladesh reached 16 percent, and prices of rice has doubled in the past year, according to the government's Food Planning and Monitoring Unit.\n",

The news came as workers in communist-ruled China prepared to celebrate May 1, Labour Day, as a national holiday. But the latest incident showed that labour abuse remained a major problem in China, where many poor people remain vulnerable to exploitation despite the nation's phenomenal economic growth, according to one workers' rights group. \"They (labour scandals) get exposed from time to time.

In a speech marking Eritrea's 17th anniversary since independence, Issaias said he was duty-bound to cushion Eritrea's 4.2 million population from the affects of rising food prices which have hit poorest nations the hardest. \"Considering the direction to which the global economy is heading, not only is the price of food items soaring but speculation suggests that their very availability could be endangered. Hence, it is imperative for food security to become the priority of priorities for us and many other poor nations,\" he said in a speech posted in information ministry website. \"Due evaluation will be undertaken as regards our fiscal policies, import regulations, price control, supply and provision of consumer goods, and the like, in the wake of which the necessary practical measures will be taken,\" he added. In 2005, the Asmara government halted the distribution of most food aid to its poor population, saying the country was working to promote self-reliance among the population. It also refused to renew permits for aid workers.\n",

Jean Zwahlen, who chaired the symposium, also shared Yunus' optimism about microfinance, saying that it would \"show its resilience\" in the face of the financial crisis. But Yunus warned that a global economic slowdown would \"affect the lives of the poor people much more\" than others.\n",

Britain's development minister on Tuesday urged the United Nations to put better-qualified people in charge of relief operations, saying lives are at risk from poorly-managed aid projects. \"One of the major problems is that many country-based UN humanitarian coordinators don't have the skills or right background to do their jobs,\" international development minister Gareth Thomas told a meeting of the UN refugee agency's executive council. \"We need to work harder to get the right people into these roles early enough, keep them there and make them accountable,\" he said. \"These people are the lynchpins to the whole humanitarian effort when crises happen,\" Thomas added.

      "Billion going hungry on World Food Day, says Oxfam. Oxfam launched an urgent appeal to mark UN World Food Day Thursday, saying the financial crisis had sent food costs soaring and the global total of people in hunger to nearly one billion people. The British-based aid and development charity said rising food prices had pushed an extra 119 million people into hunger, meaning 967 million people were now living below the hunger line. In \"Double Edged Prices\", a report being launched in London, Oxfam argued that the increase in food costs had seen some international companies quadruple their profits while the world's poor were pushed further into destitution. Oxfam said it needed an extra 15 million pounds (26.2 million dollars, 19.3 million euros) to fund its development and humanitarian work on food and agriculture, and to campaign for changes to \"flawed trade and agricultural polices\" afflicting poor farmers. \"These are tough times for many of us, but huge increases in food prices mean that the world’s poorest are being hit hardest,\" said Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking, saying anything people could give would make a difference.\n",

      "Financial crunch could deepen food crisis: UN. The ongoing global financial crunch could undermine aid to developing countries and spur protectionism, which would both worsen the food crisis, the UN food agency said Wednesday. \"The great uncertainty now enveloping international markets and the threat of global recession may tempt countries towards protectionism and towards reassessing their commitments to international development aid,\" FAO chief Jacques Diouf said in a statement. A new food crisis could arise next year despite an expected record cereal harvest this year, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said. Three dozen countries have experienced crop failures, conflict or insecurity, or continuing local high prices, the FAO added in a statement. Diouf noted that the financial crisis, following hard on the heels of the soaring food price crisis which threw an additional 75 million people into hunger and poverty in 2007 alone, may well deepen the plight of the poor in developing countries.\n",

He inherited power from his father Kim Il-Sung, who founded North Korea and died in 1994, in the communist world's only dynastic succession. Kim Jong-Il, the chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission, rules the totalitarian communist state with a trademark \"Songun\" -- or army-first -- policy. He is general secretary of the ruling communist Workers' Party. ECONOMY: The North's economy is in dire straits with chronic food shortages after years of failed centralised policies and natural disasters. It suffered famine in the mid- to late 1990s which killed hundreds of thousands of people. It has since heavily relied on outside aid to feed its 24 million population but remains under various US and UN sactions. MILITARY: North Korea boasts a military of around 1.2 million. It has been developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles and conducted a first atomic bomb test in 2006. It also tested a long-range Taepodong-1 missile in 1998 and a longer-range Taepodong-2, which in theory can reach Alaska, in 2006. It has talked of another Taepodong-2 test this year. HISTORY: North Korea was created in 1948, three years after Japan's defeat in World War II that ended Tokyo's 35-year-long colonial rule. Founding leader Kim Il-Sung successfully cemented his rule with a personality cult and ruled under a \"Juche\" or self-reliance policy until his death.

He cautioned that \"not a single country has been lifted out of poverty as a result of development aid alone.\" \"The key factor has proved to be the quality of leadership and governance, or 'ownership,'\" Richelle added. \"Development cooperation is just one element and should be based on respect for that ownership.

Pope Benedict XVI appeared back on form Friday a day after he was roughly assaulted at St Peter's Basilica, urging tolerance towards migrants in his traditional Christmas message. \"In the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger, intolerance or environmental degradation,\" the Roman Catholic Church calls for \"an attitude of acceptance and welcome,\" he said. The spiritual leader of the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics said society remains \"deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and \"the painful wounds of war and conflict.

Africa's leading aid donor, the EU remains its top trading partner, but risks being shoved aside as Brazil, India and other emerging giants join China in chasing the spoils of a resource-rich continent recording the globe's top growth rate. That, along with the absence of Europe's \"big three\" -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron -- makes it all the harder to imagine a breakthrough on Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's demand for five billion euros annually from the EU to deal with the ticking migration bomb.\n",

      "Bangladesh pushes for climate cash as UN meets in Cancun. Bangladesh on Wednesday called for billions of dollars to be made available quickly for its fight against climate change, as United Nations' environment talks entered their third day in Mexico. The low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years, environment minister Hasan Mahmud told reporters in Dhaka. The UN summit in Cancun, Mexico, is considering a so-called Green Fund that would help channel aid to poor countries likely to suffer the worst effects of climate change in the coming decades. \"It must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012,\" Mahmud said. \"The number of storms, floods, tidal surges and droughts hitting Bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years. It has worsened poverty.\" According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a one- metre (three-foot) rise in sea levels would flood 17 percent of Bangladesh and create 20 million climate refugees.\n",

Corruption, bad governance and extreme poverty put the lives of thousands of diamond miners at risk in Central African Republic, leading some to join armed rebel groups, a think-tank said Thursday. The diamond wealth of the country, one of the poorest in the world, has benefited \"grasping regimes\" and foreign entrepreneurs more than its people, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said, calling for fundamental reforms. \"In the diamond mines of the Central African Republic (CAR), extreme poverty and armed conflict put thousands of lives in danger,\" it said in a report, \"Dangerous Little Stones\", released on its website (www.crisisgroup.org). About 80,000-100,000 mostly unlicenced miners dig for diamonds with picks and shovels and in precarious conditions, ICG said, with industrial-scale mining largely failing. President Francois Bozize \"keeps tight control of the diamond sector to enrich and empower his own ethnic group\" but does little to alleviate the poverty of the informal miners, it said.\n",

The foundation would \"instead (be) redoubling efforts to fulfil its core charitable mission of delivering aid and relief to disadvantaged populations, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa,\" the statement added. The announcement marks a sharp change of tack for the foundation which since its creation in 1997 had made a name for its vocal campaigning for opening up Libya's political system and heavily state-controlled economy, and for its annual reports on the regime's human rights record. Seif al-Islam defended the change in the statement. \"I am confident that this shift will allow us to direct our efforts in the most important areas in which we work, improving people's lives in some of the poorest areas on Earth,\" he said.\n",

A leading relief organization announced Monday that it would leave Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire because of the poor security there. In a statement issued in London, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said members of the former Rwandan authorities were policing the camps and brutalizing refugees who want to return to Rwanda through ``intimidation, arrest or assassination.'' The Hutu militias consider those who want to return traitors, as Rwanda is now under the control of the Tutsis. Medecins Sans Frontieres also said that their volunteers, as well as volunteers belonging to other humanitarian organizations, had been threatened and arrested by the Hutu militiamen. Last month international aid workers left the Katale refugee camp, home to 270,000 Rwandan Hutus, for five days after more than 200 Hutus took control of the camp and seven staff members were threatened.\n",

      "Humanitarian Aid Convoys Impeded By Serbian Ban, U.N. Says. Bosnians Serbs found new ways to thwart U.N. operations on Sunday, effectively stopping humanitarian aid convoys to the country's most vulnerable areas. The Serbs said they would no longer allow U.N. armored personnel carriers to escort aid convoys through the 70 percent of the country they control. Aid workers said they could not work without U.N. protection. ``I think this is just another way of making life difficult for the U.N.,'' said Lt. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo. The Serbs lifted restrictions on most of the 200 peacekeepers they had been holding hostage, the United Nations said. But they continued harassing U.N. forces in other ways. A three-truck Danish fuel convoy was hijacked in Bosnian Serb territory Saturday night after gunmen, armed with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, blocked the front and rear of the convoy, von Merveldt said.\n",

      "GOP Looks at Old Target  Foreign Aid  for Budget Cuts. The new Republican-led Congress is aiming at an old target as it seeks to cut government spending, proposing drastic reductions in the dlrs 13.7 billion that the United States gives to other countries. The Democratic Clinton administration protests that its foreign aid programs already are cut to the bone -- reduced 20 percent in the last two years. But some key Republicans are trying to pare as much as one third of the money for development, economic assistance and population and environmental programs in poor countries. ``This is probably the greatest, most fundamental debate on foreign aid since the end of the Vietnam War,'' said Robert Berg, a United Nations consultant and president of the International Development Conference, a non-profit forum on global development issues. The government's principal assistance arm, the Agency for International Development, has launched a major pre-emptive defense, arguing moral responsibility and economics. Forty percent of U.S. exports go to the developing world, it says, leading to more jobs at home. At issue is less than 1 percent of the national budget, along with a basic philosophical debate over the U.S. role in the developing world, where poor nations are at risk of dissolving into famine, conflict and chaos.\n",

The British leader arrived in Dhaka Tuesday on a 3-day visit. A 10-month political standoff, during which almost all the opposition members of Parliament quit, has led to violent street protests, strikes and resulted in a slowdown of the economy. Efforts to hammer out a compromise between Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and the opposition, which wants her out on charges of corruption, inefficiency and vote fraud, have failed. Bangladesh, a country of 120 million, mostly poor, people and prone to natural disasters, is the second highest recipient of British bilateral aid after India.

Pope John Paul II has agreed to a White House proposal to use Church resources around the world to help focus relief aid in war and famine zones, according to a document obtained Monday. The pontiff stressed the ``urgent need for practical solidarity'' in welcoming the initiative offered last month by President Clinton, who said reports from clergy and Church-backed aid groups could better identify the types of food and medicines needed in trouble spots. The pope's response was included in a letter to Clinton from Raymond Flynn, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, who has served as the intermediary between the White House and Church officials on the new aid network. The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, said the pope asked Flynn to begin meetings with a Vatican official to work out details of the program. The Vatican has not released the text of the pope's letter, which Clinton received last week. Flynn wrote that the pontiff mentioned ``how pleased he was to receive your letter and ... hoped there would be important opportunities to coordinate our efforts to better serve victims of disease, war and natural disasters.''\n",

BUCHANAN, Liberia (AP) - Civilians straggling into this safe haven Thursday described rebel executions in their villages and said thousands of people were trapped by fighting in the countryside. United Nations officials and aid workers in Buchanan, which is controlled by foreign peacekeepers, said about 600 people were arriving daily and many were sleeping outside because of crowded conditions. The latest fighting comes despite a Dec. 20 peace accord that is quickly collapsing amid the warlords' failure to set up a temporary government. Talks in neighboring Ghana were adjourned Wednesday because of the stalemate over who should sit on the five-member ruling council. The deadlock and the resumption of hostilities confirmed fears among diplomats and civilians that the latest accord would fall victim to faction leaders' hunger for power. Under the accord, the ruling council was to govern Liberia until elections in November. But the council was to have been seated in early January, and the delays make it likely the elections and disarmament will also be postponed.

      "HOLD FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY, FEB. 22, AT 0900 GMT. The International Labor Organization said Wednesday that the chances of reducing record levels of global unemployment are remote in the next few years, and it urged a policy overhaul. Contradicting Western trends and advice from other international bodies, the U.N. agency said abolition of minimum wages and other measures to cut labor costs are not the solution in industrialized nations. In its ``World Employment'' report, the ILO said the main hope for rich and poor countries alike lays in boosting prosperity through freer trade and export-led growth. It brushed aside fears about manufacturing jobs moving from the United States and Europe to cheap labor countries, saying these would be more than offset by gains in high-tech and service industries. ``In 1994, 30 percent of the global labor force -- about 820 million people -- were unemployed or underemployed in what has become the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s,'' the ILO said. In industrialized countries, 35 million workers were without a job. ``Under current scenarios, growth will not be sufficient to cure Europe's endemic employment ills, reverse the decline in real U.S. incomes, halt the spread of poverty and underemployment in developing countries or prevent the marginalization of an entire continent -- Africa.''\n",

      "``Glorious Project'' Urges Entrepreneurs to Help Fight Poverty. The Chinese government is trying to mobilize entrepreneurs to help fight poverty by investing in poor areas, an official newspaper reported Tuesday. Called the ``Glorious Project,'' the campaign encourages businesses to view the country's most poverty-stricken regions as potential promised lands, the China Daily reported. As part of the government's campaign to help eliminate poverty in seven years, the so-called Glorious Project encourages investment in poor areas, mainly in northwest and southwest China. The goal is to establish 700 investment programs, develop 70 kinds of resources and train 7,000 local workers by the year 2000, the report said. Begun a year ago, the project already involves more than 2,600 business people from 30 provinces and regions. Approximately 80 million Chinese, mostly peasants and ethnic minorities in remote border regions, live on less than 300 yuan (dlrs 35.71) a year.\n",

      "Non-Serbs Flee As Aid Agencies Stand By Helpless. Far from any battlefields, Muslims and Croats are quietly leaving this Serb stronghold. Oppression, both subtle and overt, has worn down their resistance and resolve to stay. Profiteering Serbs are happy to help them leave -- for a price. Aid workers have long faced a moral dilemma. Helping Muslims and Croats leave in effect helps the Serbs achieve their goal of ethnic purity in regions they control. But without the help of international aid agencies, non-Serbs wishing to leave are more vulnerable to robbery, harassment, or being run out of town at gunpoint. ``What is important is that they leave in decent condition, at least, and not have to cross over mine fields, that they can take some of their personal belongings,'' said Erich Duerst, head of the Banja Luka office of the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n",

Golf courses and Hawaii Ice Cream parlors are next on his list. ``Six years ago, I never dreamed all this could happen.

He and Pun are among the first wealthy entrepreneurs in one of the last Asian countries to turn to free enterprise.

Sick, starving and facing certain death if they remained in their gruesome surroundings, scores of refugees Saturday left the camp where they holed up a week ago in defiance of government orders. About 100 people, including a woman with a two-day-old baby, trudged across the corpses, garbage and human waste virtually carpeting the compound to begin the trek back to villages they fled after last year's civil war. Hundreds remained inside the Kibeho compound, but many began stuffing belongings into sacks, their resistance diminished by hunger and illness. Most people inside the courtyard and surrounding brick buildings are Hutus, the ethnic majority blamed for last year's genocide that killed about 500,000 people, most of them from the Tutsi minority. Hutus fled to camps like Kibeho as Tutsi-led rebels siezed control of the government. The army began closing the camps two weeks ago, saying they were harboring Hutu militants. But many refugees refused to leave, afraid they would be attacked by Tutsis if they returned home.

By moving to dismember the U.S. foreign aid program, the 104th Congress is reversing a half-century tradition that sharing tax dollars with the world's poor is as American as Coca-Cola and General Motors. Last November's congressional elections revealed a change in American attitudes that scholars and aid specialists reckon developed gradually and is based largely on misinformation and misperceptions. ``Americans are the most generous people on earth. They can see a picture of a pitiful starving kid on television ... and they'll pull out their checkbooks and start writing,'' said Ismail Serageldin, Egyptian-born vice president of the World Bank. ``But yet they want their government to cut development aid.'' The House of Representatives, under control of the conservative Republican party for the first time in 40 years, has begun the process. Its International Relations Committee expects to send to the full House on Monday a bill that in its present form would cut the Clinton administration's foreign aid requests by 34 percent.

President Clinton will refuse to sign welfare reform legislation that sends the food stamp program to the states as a block grant and ends the federal government's promise to help needy Americans buy groceries, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says. Glickman said the president's ``bottom-line position'' is that the food stamp program must not be converted into block grants to states, with spending set at fixed amounts rather than being allowed to grow to reflect increases in poverty, unemployment or natural disasters. Some Republican governors, notably Michigan's John Engler, are pressing the Senate to send food stamps to the states as part of the Republicans' plan to reform the nation's welfare system and curb spending on the poor by tens of billions of dollars. House-passed welfare legislation would keep the government's guarantee to provide food stamps to anyone who meets the eligibility requirements but would scale back yearly increases in benefits and require able-bodied, single adults to find work. The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, was scheduled to take up legislation Wednesday that would cancel the government's 60-year-old guarantee to support single mothers and children and replace Aid to Families With Dependent Children with a block grant.\n",

      "UNDATED: daily lives.. The Christian life is a dynamic reality: The seed of faith sown in our hearts through baptism must ripen and mature into a rich harvest of union with God and good works in the service of others. Jesus uses the image of the harvest to describe the church's role in the world. From generation to generation, in every time and place, the seed sown by God in human history through the death and resurrection of Christ continues to mature and awaits the harvest. Jesus reminds us that more workers for the harvest are urgently needed, and he commands us to pray for them: ``The harvest is rich but the workers are few; therefore ask the harvest master to send workers to his harvest.'' The question of vocations is vital to the church. Everyone has a vocation: parents, teachers, students, workers, professional people, people who are retired. Everyone has something to do for God. We must pray that young people especially will listen to the Lord's call to serve as priests, as religious sisters and brothers, as missionaries at home and in other lands. Young people of Newark and New Jersey, young Americans, the Lord needs you! The church needs you! Compared to many other parts of the world, the United States is a privileged, privileged land. Yet, even here there is much poverty and human suffering. There is much need for love and the works of love; there is need for social solidarity. Early Americans were proud of their strong sense of individual responsibility, but that did not lead them to build a radically individualistic society. They built a community-based society, community-based society with a great openness and sensitivity to the needs of their neighbors. Quite close to the shores of New Jersey there rises a universally known landmark which stands as an enduring witness to the American tradition of welcoming the stranger, and which tells us something important about the kind of nation America has aspired to be. It is the Statue of Liberty, Statue of Liberty, with its celebrated poem: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ... Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.'' Is present-day America becoming less sensitive, less caring towards the poor, the weak, the stranger, the needy? It must not! Today, as before, the United States is called to be a hospitable society, a welcoming culture. If America were to turn in on itself, would this not be the beginning of the end of what constitutes the very essence of the American experience? To a great extent, the story of America has been the story of long and difficult struggles to overcome the prejudices which excluded certain categories of people from a full share in the country's life: first, the struggle against religious intolerance, then the struggle against racial discrimination and in favor of civil rights for everyone. Sadly, today a new class of people is being excluded. When the unborn child _ the stranger in the womb _ is declared to be beyond the protection of society, not only are America's deepest traditions radically undermined and endangered, but a moral blight is brought upon society. I am also thinking of threats to the elderly, the severely handicapped and all those who do not seem to have any social usefulness. When innocent human beings are declared inconvenient or burdensome, and thus unworthy of legal and social protection, grievous damage is done to the moral foundations of the democratic society, community. The right to life is the first of all rights. It is the foundation of democratic liberties and the keystone of the edifice of civil society. Both as Americans and as followers of Christ, American Catholics must be committed to the defense of life in all its stages and in every condition.\n",

      "Rich Getting Healthier, Poor Getting Sicker By EDITH M. LEDERER. In a poor barrio of Cali, Colombia, community workers taught the unemployed to build houses in two months. Then, they built malls with shops and health centers and helped small entrepreneurs. The result? Healthier children and happier parents. In the American city of Baltimore, medical experts used the ``barefoot doctor'' concept pioneered by China to help poor patients suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure. The result? Fewer hospital visits, a better quality of life and substantial savings.

      "None. Royalty, couturiers, celebrities and development experts have joined hands to put glitz and glamor in fashion from Bangladesh as a way for the country to combat famine and abject poverty. Queen Sophia of Spain and Brazil's First Lady Ruth Cardoso were among nearly 2,000 people who applauded UNESCO's Bangladesh weavers' demonstration and fashion show Wednesday night. A fabric display will continue for a week at the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. ``UNESCO is not planning to get into the fashion business,'' said the organization's general director, Federico Mayor. ``But we want to open the window of Paris on the weavers of Bangladesh.'' The clothes were bright, ethnic and contemporary, and ranged from traditional checked cottons based on what Bangladeshi wear, with tunics and bare-midriff skirts - to silks fit for royalty. Most outfits - for both men and women - were designed by a lissome former model and London fashion student from Bangladesh, Bibi Russell. ``This should be the beginning of cooperative worldwide efforts between creators and artisans to create a world free from poverty,'' she said. The show closed with a rollicking folkoric dance onstage with young Bangladesh student-models and Mayor and others dancing to the compelling rhythms. Actress Marisa Berenson, special ambassador to UNESCO, swung about with the young Bangladeshis, who had just flown in from their country east of India. Queen Sophia told Rosette Mett, owner-designer of the house of Torrente, that she'd soon be wearing one of Torrente's blue and cream safari skirt suits, a product of the Bangladesh weavers shown at UNESCO's parade. Nearly 8,000 weavers are now producing again with backing from Grameen Bank, founded 20 years ago by Muhammad Yunus. Grameen means ``rural'' in Bengali. The weaving cooperative project was founded in 1991. From abject poverty, the poorest of the poor are working their way back to dignity. Looms in Bangladesh are clacking, and the country is producing fabric for fashions, their own native style or haute couture, guided by experts like Russell, who designs and supervises quality control. High fashion is applauding the effort. One fan is Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, a French designer who passionately loves ethnic creativity and natural materials. ``You might call me a Don Quixote,'' he said during the fashion show. ``But I'm interested in couture of the whole world, whether the fabrics come from Fez, Morocco, or Limoges, France, or Dacca, Bangladesh. Fashion is a way to seek spirituality and peace.'' The ecologically-oriented designer also finds this symbiosis of cultures a ``kind of sign language,'' and says he wants to go on working with Bangladeshis, as he has for several years. ``I'd like to promote their fabric with others. These things must be an interchange,'' he said. Yunus _ who studied at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and was a professor at the University of Chittagong _ aims to help the most impoverished of his compatriots by furnishing raw materials, without demanding collateral. He recommended seed money to sponsor cottage industries, usually depending on women, and eventually hit on the idea of reviving the weaving industry. By last year, Grameen Bank had 1,052 branches. It had disbursed loans of over dlrs 1.5 billion, had savings in a group fund of dlrs 107 million and financed the building of 326,754 houses with loans. For textile weaving Yunus got help from Russel, who studied fashion in England, married an Englishman and became a model but finally returned to Bangladesh with a mission to help her people revive artisan and creative pursuits. She started designing fabric patterns, then clothes, to promote Bangladeshi fabrics. ``I want to show the beautiful things we have,'' said Bibi Russell after the fashion show. She uses only natural substances for her styles, including jewelry and accessories of wood, straw and shells. At the weaving demonstration, two Bangladeshis on their first trip abroad clacked away at their looms. Their beautiful luminous plaids in soft cotton fabrics were displayed around the hall. ``We're aiming for a 1996 target of 10 million metres (yards) of our high-quality fabrics, and will be putting 15,000 weavers to work,'' said Yunus. slot v0153/tw\n",

Echoing a familiar theme in the state-controlled press, a top leader of the military government blamed the pro-democratic opposition for trying to isolate Burma and deny it foreign aid. ``Destructionists at the behest of neocolonialists are trying to discredit the country and hamper the country's development by disseminating false information with negative outlook,'' said Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Secretary-1 of the junta, in remarks published in state newspapers Sunday. He spoke at a political training course for high school teachers in Hmawbi, near Rangoon. Without directly naming them, Khin Nyunt blamed the pro-democracy movement and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, for trying to isolate Burma from the world community and for writing to international organizations to ask that they not provide funds to the junta. ``Attempts by lackeys of neocolonialists to prevent foreign assistance and investments until they get power obviously amounts to denying the human rights and development of 45 million people in the country,'' said Khin Nyunt.\n",

Democracy in government and modernization in the economy remain distant goals for the Balkan states, which are left far behind their former sister socialist satellites to the north. The gap is even widening as investments from the West tend to stress the more stable north, led by the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, which are the priority candidates in the proposed EU and NATO expansion. In order to prevent future conflicts and ensure genuine stability in Europe, moral and material support needs to be strengthened for the poor and underdeveloped Balkans. While a significant psychological distance exists between Japan and Eastern Europe, we cannot afford to be indifferent, as this country is involved in assistance to the region through the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. ___ MORE\n",

      "Top U.S. officials meet with Haitian leader. Two senior U.S. officials met with President Rene Preval on Thursday to review Haiti's progress in democracy, just weeks after a critical report from the U.S. State Department. ``The United States remains deeply committed to supporting Haiti's democratic and economic development,'' a U.S. Embassy statement said of Preval's meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. The U.S. officials also reviewed ``programs designed to foster economic and social development'' on their one-day visit, the embassy said. The United States gave Haiti dlrs 116 million in fiscal 1996 and has promised dlrs 100 million this year. But tens of millions of dollars in international aid is being held up until the 1996-97 budget is ratified and a commission set up to privatize state-controlled companies is fully operational. A State Department human rights report in January was highly critical of Haiti's ``weak and corrupt'' judiciary and a police force accused of killing innocent civilians and mistreating detainees.\n",

      "Ld-Writethru to some points, UPDATING with. More than 1,000 ethnic Tamils arrived in government territory in the biggest exodus of refugees from areas controlled by rebels in northern Sri Lanka, the military said Tuesday. The group was part of a continuing exodus to the Jaffna Peninsula. The military says the Tamils are fleeing harassment by the Tamil rebels. The rebels say a shortage of supplies due to a military blockade are forcing people out. There is no independent corroboration of the claims because reporters aren't allowed to the region and few aid workers work there. Continued fighting in the area, however, is considered one of the reasons why the Tamils are leaving. Relief officials say Tamil civilians have been living in poor conditions under trees or in makeshift refugee camps since the military wrested control of the Jaffna Peninsula some 18 months ago.\n",

Japanese activists announced Wednesday a campaign against a flood control and irrigation project funded by the Japanese government, saying it will displace thousands of Filipinos and destroy farms and fishing grounds. Earlier this year, scores of Filipino farmers and fishermen protested at Japan's embassy against Japanese funding of the flood control plan, part of the bigger Pampanga Delta Development Project. Japan is providing 65 percent of the flood control plan's 2.7 billion peso (dlrs 90 million) cost. ``We vow to continue and intensify our campaign in Japan against the PDDP and all other Japanese-funded anti-people and ecologically destructive development projects in the Philippines,'' said Koki Yoshimura of the Tokyo-based Network Opposed to the PDDP. The group, composed mostly of academics, professionals and some small entrepreneurs, hopes to organize an anti-overseas aid movement in Japan. It arose from study groups on how Japanese tax money is being spent abroad. ``We understand that this project is using the word `development,' which means progress.

      "None. as Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, the man who will be in charge of it, took pains to explain (on Monday) That is just as well. Those western diplomats in Beijing who were said on Saturday to be `excited' by the prospect of `one of the biggest garage sales of state firms the world has ever seen' are either very stupid or indifferent to the well-being of millions of Chinese workers. Such garage sales have proved disastrous in the former Soviet bloc: reform of China's huge state sector is essential but must be managed with extreme care. ___ Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy, on UN Security Council reform: The new General Assembly of the United Nations is now meant to start the most important reform in the history of the United Nations, a reform which will close the long chapter of the cold war: The reform of the Security Council. The council needs to be reformed, in order to better reflect the new strategic and economic organization. But the American-supported reform is a slap in the face for Italy, because it represents a refusal to acknowledge its active foreign politics, just when the rest of Europe recognizes its sacrifices. Historically, and on the basis of the relations (between US and Italy) this behavior is hard to explain. The slap was probably non-intentional. ... Still American carelessness towards Italy raises a doubt over its international strategy. ... American foreign policy runs the risk of becoming an inactive one, without either a general plan, or a strong leadership. ___ The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on China: By small degrees, the Communist Party of China is moving forward with its own transformation, if not destruction. The development of economic policy, drawn in broad outline at the opening of the 15th party congress in Beijing last Friday, increases the distance between economic freedom, which is now very great, and political freedom which, except in a highly artificial sense, is still nowhere in sight. ... There will be a thorough shake-up of state-run enterprises (reducing their number from 130,000 to a strategically placed 512). And the People's Liberation Army, already reduced by almost a quarter in the 1980s under Deng Xiaoping, is to be further reduced by 500,000 by the turn of the century from its present strength of 3.1 million. ... But that ``downsizing'' will mean that many workers _ as well as PLA personnel _ will lose not only their jobs but also health, housing and other benefits of the old cradle-to-grave communist system. China's stability under communism has always depended on the alliance between the party and the armed forces. But the PLA cannot stand against history. And the party, despite its 58 million members, cannot credibly claim to be representative of China's population of almost 1 billion. ___ Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Mother Teresa's passing: Her life and work as a Catholic nun that won acceptance and respect in an overwhelmingly Hindu country fraught with religious, ethnic and caste conflicts posed a profound challenge to the international community at large. She was not a secular reformist bent on waging war on poverty, driven by a sense of mission and brandishing justice. She did not seek achievements by her will and power, but followed a transcendental command that she live for the sake of the forsaken. ... This life of Mother Teresa has given an answer to questions that face present-day religious faiths. Since the Reformation no fundamental challenge has been posed to Christianity. The same goes with other religions as well. Although religions were meant for the poor and the wretched in the first place, they have been absorbed by the ruling structures to serve the interests of the rich and powerful, and have been deprived of energy of change in the process. At a time when as much as one-third of the world population is still left out in poverty, Mother Teresa's life and service demonstrate that religion still exists for the poor, and that living for the sake of others makes such an invaluable life. meer v0439/tw\n",

      "PETERS. The United Nations on Tuesday said Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have no right to be offended by foreign aid workers who decline to follow local religious laws while on U.N. property. Taliban officials disrupted a meeting last week at a U.N. office in Kandahar by demanding a visiting human rights lawyer give her presentation from behind a screen in the corner of the conference room. She did, but three male foreign air workers walked out of the meeting in protest. The Taliban officials then expelled the three male workers, saying they had insulted Afghan traditions and ignored the law of the land. The United Nations officially protested the expulsion on Tuesday, saying U.N. premises are ``extra-territorial'' so Taliban officials had no right to try to enforce their laws at the meeting. This latest incident reflects the strict religious laws being enforced by the Taliban, controllers of the southern two-thirds of Afghanistan. The behavior of women especially is stringent under the laws, which bans them from working, going to school or fraternizing with men who are not relatives.\n",

Drought and flooding have compounded years of economic mismanagement and the loss of aid from the former Soviet Union.

The 23-year-old refugee said he saw his neighbors eat their daughter, the representatives from Doctors Without Borders said in a report compiled from interviews conducted during a tour of areas along the Chinese border with North Korea. A Chinese-Korean who sometimes crosses the border to take food and other essentials to his former hometown in North Korea said one woman ate her 2-year-old child to stave off hunger, the aid workers said. They also quoted the director of an orphanage in the Chinese border town of Yanji as saying she met an 18-year-old North Korean refugee who said her neighbor killed, salted and ate an uncared-for orphan. There have been other persistent but unconfirmed reports of cannibalism in famine-stricken North Korea. The communist nation's food shortages stem from economic mismanagement and natural disasters in the past three years that devastated crops.\n",

      "MBITIRU. Another round of peace talks to end the 15-year civil war in southern Sudan was scheduled Monday in Nairobi, but few of those who follow the arduous process believe any signficant progress will be made on the principal divisive issues _ religion and autonomy. The talks come as the United Nations and humanitarian aid agencies are warning of a possible famine in southern Sudan where up to 700,000 people in areas controlled by rebels and government troops were unable to plant crops that would have been harvested now because of an upsurge in fighting and severe drought. Relief agencies and Britain had accused the Khartoum government of denying access by air to the regions under the most serious threat of starvation. On Sunday, Khartoum agreed to allow more relief flights into the southwestern Bahr el Ghazal region and other areas in need of food. The talks _ the eighth round since 1984 _ are held under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development or IGAD, a regional development body whose current chairman is Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.\n",

      "More World Bank aid to Indonesia if reforms protect human rights. Britain's top finance official told President Suharto on Wednesday that Indonesia would receive more World Bank aid if political reforms ``respected individual life.'' ``I made it clear to the president that the economic reform which is necessary must be backed up by political reform that respects individual life,'' Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown told reporters after meeting with Suharto. Brown's comments came as police tried to control riots that erupted in several cities around Indonesia in response to massive price rises for fuel and other essential commodities. Brown said he told Suharto that social reform was necessary to help the poor and unemployed who had been hardest hit by the nation's economic downslide. ``I said to him the World Bank would give more to help it he were prepared to take the action necessary to protect those who have been victim to this process,'' said Brown, who is the equivalent of finance minister.\n",

      "World Bank approves dlrs 85 million loan for Chinese projects. The World Bank has approved a dlrs 85 million loan to support projects aimed at improving health facilities for rural China's poor and to make health care more affordable. By improving health care for some 48 million people, the bank hopes to help alleviate poverty and contribute to long-term economic development in endemically poor areas, said a statement released late Wednesday by the bank's Beijing office. With the disappearance of welfare facilities once maintained by communal farms, health care has deteriorated in many parts of rural China. Scarce funds have hampered government efforts to reverse the trend. The loan will go to projects focusing on basic health care, particularly for mothers and children; immunization; tuberculosis control and will provide financial assistance to clinics that serve the very poor, the bank said. The loan will be provided over six years on concessionary terms. The Chinese government will provide an additional dlrs 44.2 million for the projects, it said.\n",

The benefits of open societies and open markets must be delivered to ``not just some, but all of our people.'' Addressing foreign ministers from 34 countries, Albright said children are staying in school longer, women are gaining more access to education and health care, and 1 million people are to receive loans for micro-enterprises in the next few years. Still, overall poverty in the region has gone up since 1980, with a record 210 million people now below the poverty line, according to the OAS. Latin America suffers the greatest gap between poor and rich in the world; in some countries, 10 percent of the population controls 50 percent or more of the wealth, the OAS says.\n",

      "CRARY. Seeking to defuse anger in Canada's poorest region, the federal government said Friday it will spend another dlrs 730 million (dlrs 496 million U.S.) to aid East Coast fishermen and fish-plant workers who lost jobs when cod stocks collapsed. The fish workers _ most of them in Newfoundland _ have staged repeated protests in recent months as the government tried to cut short the original dlrs 1.9 billion (dlrs 1.3 billion U.S.) relief program. The original five-year program, known as TAGS (The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy), ran short of money because more people than expected qualified for extended benefits after the government ordered a near-total halt to the cod fishery in 1993. About 40,000 fish workers in the Atlantic provinces lost their jobs because of the cod moratorium, and about half remain eligible for benefits. The aid package announced Friday, after weeks of political wrangling, includes lump-sum relief packages to some jobless fish workers, funding for non-fishery economic development projects, money for job training and dlrs 250 million (dlrs 170 million U.S.) for the government to buy back some commercial fishing licenses.\n",

      "documents atrocities in Kosovo. Both the government of President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo's Albanian rebels have committed atrocities in seven months of conflict, but government abuses have been on a far greater scale, Human Rights Watch said in a report issued Sunday. The New York-based human rights organization blamed the international community for failing to take any serious action to stop the killing of mostly Albanian civilians in the ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province. ``The tentative international response has been driven by fear of either endorsing Kosovo independence or being drawn into a long-term commitment of forces to maintain a peaceful settlement within former Yugoslavia'' it said. The report came just one day before U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan was to deliver his own assessment to the Security Council on whether Belgrade is complying with U.N. demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air attacks will come within two weeks. Human Rights Watch said Serbian police and military ``committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, systematically destroyed civilian property and attacked humanitarian aid workers, all of which are violations of the rules of war.''\n",

Fighting between government forces and rebels in Guinea-Bissau abated Thursday, allowing aid workers to address the mounting humanitarian crisis in the small west African nation. The Red Cross and World Food Program said they were struggling to care for tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in the former Portuguese colony of some 1 million people. ``We're completely overwhelmed by the situation,'' Wagdi Othman of the World Food Program said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, from where he is coordinating the aid effort. The rebels _ mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and conditions _ control most of Guinea-Bissau after sweeping through the countryside since fighting restarted Sunday, ending a three-month truce. The government announced a unilateral cease-fire late Wednesday and said it was ready to talk peace with the insurgents. The insurgents reacted cautiously, saying they wanted greater guarantees before entering into peace talks.\n",

The global economic crisis and a rash of natural disasters threaten to roll back improvements in providing universal basic social services, a U.N.-sponsored conference heard Tuesday. ``As always, the weakest among us are the ones to suffer the most,'' Hilde F. Johnson, Norway's minister of international development and human rights, told the opening session on implementation of the ``20/20 Initiative.'' ``The global economic crisis is forcing people out of work, families out of their homes and children out of their schools.'' Under the 20-20 Initiative, governments are supposed to allocate 20 percent of their budgets _ and donors 20 percent of their aid _ to ensure basic education, primary health care, reproductive health and population programs, nutrition programs and safe water and sanitation. Representatives from more than 60 nations and multilateral organizations are attending the three-day meeting as a follow-up to a conference in Norway 2 1/2 years ago that forged the initiative.\n",

      "UNDP official says North Korea needs agricultural recovery aid. North Korea needs international aid to help its farmers produce as much food as they did in the early 1990s, before natural disasters pushed the country to the brink of famine, the U.N. Development Program's chief said Tuesday. North Korea is expected to produce 3 million tons of food this year, only two-thirds of its ``very basic minimum needs'' and half of what it produced in the early 1990s, James Gustave Speth, the UNDP administrator, told reporters after a trip in North Korea. Four years of chronic food shortages caused by crop-destroying weather and government mismanagement have left North Korea's economy in tatters and its people heavily reliant on foreign aid. U.N. aid agencies plan to launch an appeal to provide fertilizer and other support for agriculture, Speth said. The goal is to help the North grow enough of its own food so that food aid can end. Restoring agriculture would be cheaper than continuing food aid, which ``can't continue forever,'' Speth said.\n",

Japanese blue chips rose on buying by public funds, but worries over upcoming corporate earnings reports kept trading subdued. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent, closing at 13,668.72.

(ASIAN MARKETS) MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday. Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited crisis plan, which was presented Wednesday to the International Monetary Fund. The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the Russian economy fell apart in mid-August. The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate Russians for rising inflation. It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more people pay. The IMF said it wanted to study the plan, Russian media reported. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY) ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from the Caspian Sea's rich oil fields. The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which got most participating countries _ except Russia and Turkmenistan _ to declare their support for a pipeline running from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via Georgia. The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. The United States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) pipeline and last week announced dlrs 823,000 aid for the pipeline.

(TURKEY-CASPIAN OIL) SINGAPORE (AP) _ New data show Singapore's economy shrinking for the first time since the 1980s and unemployment rising. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Thursday that gross domestic product shrank 1.5 percent in the third quarter, Singapore's first such contraction since its recession in the mid-1980s. ``Every now and then, a people is faced with a crucial test,'' Goh told a gathering of union leaders. Early data show that unemployment rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.5 percent in September, nearly double the 2.3 percent in June. About 20,000 workers lost their jobs in the first nine months of the year, equaling the record number of layoffs during Singapore's last recession. Goh blamed three factors: shrinking regional demand for its products and services; a global downturn in industries like electronics, which accounts for 77 percent of Singapore's domestic manufacturing exports; and slumping demand hurting corporate earnings, which have on average plunged 55 percent in the first half of 1998.

      "Central American leaders appeal for help as Mitch rescue efforts. Overwhelmed by disaster, grim-faced Central American leaders met Monday in El Salvador to appeal for more international aid in recovering from Hurricane Mitch even as a growing army of rescue workers struggled to help hundreds of thousands of victims. With at least 10,000 reported dead and their economies shattered by flooding, the leaders were expected to ask help with foreign debts and to coordinate long-term relief efforts after one of the worst natural disasters of this century in the Americas. Some European leaders already were proposing such help, echoing a proposal made last week by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday urged a moratorium on debt payments owed by countries hit by Hurricane Mitch. French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the Paris Club of creditor nations should suspend their debt service payments for the next two to three years. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was also urging that some debts be forgiven.\n",

In Cartagena for a three-day regional defense ministers conference, Cohen said Washington would provide more training as well as intelligence help, but gave no further details of a cooperation accord to be signed Tuesday. ``Essentially we are trying to help the Colombian military restructure itself in a way that can deal with the forces of narcotraffic and narcoterrorism and to promote greater stability and peace in the region,'' Cohen told reporters after a breakfast meeting with President Andres Pastrana. The United States already provides more than dlrs 100 million a year to fight drug trafficking in this country, which supplies 80 percent of the cocaine and much of the heroin sold in the United States. Most of the aid now goes to the police, in part due to concerns of the army's history of human rights abuses. Leftist guerrillas, who fund their decades-old insurgency by taxing cocaine production and protecting drug laboratories and airstrips in areas they control, have been gaining strength versus a poorly trained and equipped military, raising U.S. concerns about Colombia's stability.\n",

The condition of thousands of Sudanese in the war-torn south of Sudan has improved since famine peaked in the region between June and August, relief agencies said Thursday. However, Operation Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella organization of the United Nations and other aid agencies operating in Sudan, said child malnutrition rates were still unacceptably high and warned that large portions of populations in the area were still quite vulnerable. ``The population's condition is extremely fragile,'' OLS said in a statement. ``A renewed outbreak of fighting or lack of access to arable land, livestock or food and medical assistance could reverse the progress made during the last several months.'' In May, aid agencies began issuing urgent worldwide appeals to fund what has become the largest aid operation currently underway anywhere in the world, after fighting in southern Sudan brought about the worst famine in years.

      "Famine in North Korea expected to persist By ELAINE KURTENBACH. Famine will persist in North Korea, despite massive supplies of food aid, if more is not done to revive the country's decrepit rural economy, a U.N. aid coordinator said Saturday. Food shortages and famine-related illnesses have killed up to 2 million of North Korea's 23 million people during the past three years, according to U.S. congressional estimates. Two-thirds of all children under seven are malnourished, and lack of food has stunted the growth of millions more. ``If famine is defined as an acute scarcity of food, then in North Korea, for most people, famine is a reality,'' David Morton, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in North Korea told reporters. Decades of economic mismanagement combined with several years of bad weather brought the farming system in the closed communist nation to a state of collapse. North Korea is weathering its fourth winter of chronic hunger having harvested only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of its population. Humanitarian aid is keeping the situation from deteriorating further, but a reluctance by donor nations to supply development aid is hampering efforts to rehabilitate the economy, Morton said.\n",

(EU-SUMMIT) PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Encouraged by newfound peace and political stability, Prime Minister Hun Sen predicted Wednesday that Cambodia will soon achieve high economic growth and reach a level of development similar to its prosperous Southeast Asian neighbors within a few decades. At the close of the National Bank of Cambodia's annual conference, Hun Sen targeted a growth rate of 6 to 7 percent he said would initially be dependent on the poverty-stricken nation's ability to attract foreign aid and investment. The prime minister said Cambodia would follow in the development paths of regional economic dynamos Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, while working to avoid the mistakes that led to the recent Asian financial crisis. ``Thanks to high economic growth during almost the last 30 years, the economic structure and image of these countries changed considerably,'' Hun Sen told conference participants. (CAMBODIA-ECONOMY) BEIJING (AP) _ A court has rejected the appeal of a software entrepreneur sentenced to two years imprisonment in China's first Internet subversion case, a human rights group said Wednesday. The Higher People's Court in Lin Hai's home city of Shanghai turned down the 30-year-old's appeal Monday, nearly two months after it was filed, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Lin was arrested last March after giving the e-mail addresses of 30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a pro-democracy journal published on the Internet by Chinese dissidents in the United States. He stood trial Dec. 4 in a closed courtroom and was sentenced Jan. 20 for ``inciting the overthrow of state power.'' Lin appealed the verdict. His conviction was widely criticized by human rights and press freedom groups. (CHINA-INTERNET TRIAL)\n",

Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move on this circuit in expanded form: HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Friday as Japanese shares ended higher but other exchanges stumbled. In Tokyo, strong overnight gains on Wall Street supported the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 30.95 points, or 0.19 percent, to close the week at 16,016.99. On Thursday the index had gained 3.03 percent. Australian shares closed at an all-time high, driven by a strong rise in telecommunications and resources stocks, particularly oil and gold. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2996.6, up 9.7 points, or 0.3 percent. In Hong Kong, shares closed marginally lower, pulled down by selling in shares of property companies that recently reported poor profits. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 22.82 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 10,803.31. On Wednesday, the Hang Seng had gained 1.1 percent. (ASIAN MARKETS) BERLIN (AP) _ European Union leaders wrapped up two years of negotiations Friday with a complex agreement to overhaul the EU's finances so that the Union can afford to open its doors to new members from eastern Europe over the coming decade. The compromise came after 20 hours non-stop haggling over how to share out the EU's 85 billion euro (dlrs 91.8 billion) annual budget through 2006 and the leaders' determination to defend national interests left a package that fell short of the sweeping overhaul originally foreseen. France stood staunchly by its farmers, Spain defended its development aid and Britain refused to leave without its special budget rebate intact. ``It was an immensely difficult and hugely complex negotiation. But the changes pave the way for enlargement,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``Spending has been put far more firmly under control than ever before.'' (EU SUMMIT) TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan broke ground Friday for a high-speed rail line, which officials bill as the costliest transport project under way in the world even though the financing is not yet in place and it remains unclear what type of trains will roll down the tracks. Vice President Lien Chan called the 430 billion Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 13 billion) project ``a historic event'' that will help usher in advanced technologies and foster economic growth. Taiwan says the rail link will ease clogged traffic between its two largest cities, the capital of Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in the south. The trains would rush passengers between Taipei and Kaohsiung in 90 minutes, compared to about four hours on trains now in use. Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng pledged full government cooperation to the private builder, Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp., to ensure the 330-kilometer (205 mile) railroad can be inaugurated in 2003 as scheduled. (TAIWAN-HIGH-SPEED RAIL) BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's state Financial Sector Restructuring Authority said Friday it had solved a dispute with the largest successful bidder in last week's dlrs 6 billion business loan auction. The state agency Asset Management Corp., which won 29 of 44 tranches under the hammer, asked the restructuring authority to adjust its bidding terms after the auction. But the authority said it couldn't accept the demands. ``Executives of the FRA and AMC have reached an appropriate agreement that takes into account AMC's operating procedures but doesn't require the FRA to change any sales conditions for AMC or other bidders,'' the authority said in a news release. The auction was the second of business loans extended by 56 finance companies closed by the government last year. Most are nonperforming. (THAILAND-LOAN AUCTION)\n",

      "China strikes back in defense on human rights By RENEE SCHOOF. China defended its human rights record against new U.S. criticism on Tuesday, saying it was making progress in ensuring that its people enjoyed the fundamental right of survival. The long report from the State Council, the highest government body, came as the United States lobbied governments to support a resolution condemning Beijing's record before the U.N. Human Rights Commission, now meeting in Geneva. China has long tried to deflect criticism of its human rights record by arguing the supreme importance of economic development in a largely poor nation. In that vein, the lengthy report marshaled these facts: _Over the last 21 years, the number of Chinese living in severe poverty has declined from 250 million to 42 million today. _People are living longer, from an average 35 years when the communists came to power in 1949 to 71 years now.\n",

North Korea is planting more potatoes and encouraging the breeding of sheep and goats to help alleviate its chronic food shortages, a senior North Korean official has said. While conceding that North Korea faced great food shortages, Vice Foreign Minister Choi Su-hon said it had avoided massive starvation. North Koreans ``are convinced that the difficulties are temporary,'' Choi said in an interview. According to U.S. and South Korean estimates, between 2 million and 3 million people have died in four years of famine caused by floods, drought and other natural disasters that devastated North Korea's crumbling economy and left it reliant on international aid. North Korea has said those estimates are too high. According to North Korean figures released earlier this month, 220,000 people died of famine between 1995 and 1998. Choi said international aid has been ``very effective'' in alleviating North Korea's hardships and has made ``a great contribution to peace and stability in the Korean peninsula.''\n",

Delivering the annual lecture named for Wilberforce, a Hull native, Tutu said the IMF-World Bank debt relief initiative offered to 40 nations ``indicates a shift in that quarter, although no country has as yet benefited.''\n",

      "By The Associated Press. The final communique released by the G-8 Summit leaders: 1. We, the Heads of State and Government of eight major democracies and the President of the European Commission, met in Cologne for the 25th Economic Summit. On the threshold of the new millennium we discussed growing opportunities as well as forward-looking solutions to the challenges facing our nations and the international community. 2. Globalization, a complex process involving rapid and increasing flows of ideas, capital, technology, goods and services around the world, has already brought profound change to our societies. It has cast us together as never before. Greater openness and dynamism have contributed to the widespread improvement of living standards and a significant reduction in poverty. Integration has helped to create jobs by stimulating efficiency, opportunity and growth. The information revolution and greater exposure to each others' cultures and values have strengthened the democratic impulse and the fight for human rights and fundamental freedoms while spurring creativity and innovation. At the same time, however, globalization has been accompanied by a greater risk of dislocation and financial uncertainty for some workers, families and communities across the world. 3. The challenge is to seize the opportunities globalization affords while addressing its risks to respond to concerns about a lack of control over its effects. We must work to sustain and increase the benefits of globalization and ensure that its positive effects are widely shared by people all over the world. We therefore call on governments and international institutions, business and labor, civil society and the individual to work together to meet this challenge and realize the full potential of globalization for raising prosperity and promoting social progress while preserving the environment.

The 200-page 1999 World Disasters Report said global warming, deforestation and urban crowding and poverty in the developing world are escalating the spread of contagious and deadly diseases and have left populations vulnerable to natural disasters. ``The developing world will continue to be hardest hit by the escalating effects of human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population pressures,'' said the report that was presented at the start of a two-day seminar in the Ugandan capital on preparing for and averting disasters.

China will ``spare no price'' to deprive Taiwan of international breathing room, the China Times Express reported, in an apparent reference to Beijing's attempts to lure away Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies with promises of lavish aid. ``Communist China has ordered a total mobilization in diplomacy,'' the paper said. Several Taiwanese allies considered particularly vulnerable have already been singled out as targets, the paper said. China considers Taiwan a rogue province with no right to diplomatic recognition, and intense pressure from Beijing already limits Taiwan's diplomatic allies to just 29 poor countries, mostly in Africa, Central America, the Carribean and the Pacific. Taipei supports those countries with with aid, trade, and loans.\n",

The NetAid site from the United Nations was designed to make it easier for donors to contribute time or money and learn more about conditions that foster poverty. ``The launching of this Web site represents a truly new front in the struggle against poverty,'' President Clinton said in a satellite appearance from the White House. Former South African President Nelson Mandela, speaking from Johannesburg, said most of the developed world ``has the economic capacity to solve the problems of poverty, yet the gap between rich and poor is growing.''

The United Nations Children's Fund suspended its operations in southern Somalia on Monday following the killing last week of its highest-ranking health officer in the region. Ayub Sheikh Yarow, 41, died Thursday from wounds received during an apparent robbery attempt. Five other local UNICEF workers were wounded in Wednesday's assault, which occurred in Dibi Arab, a small town near Jowhar in central Somalia. UNICEF officials said Monday that all its activities in southern Somalia, including distribution of high-energy food biscuits, would cease until at least Friday, when the decision would be reconsidered. The aid suspension comes at time when famine- and war-induced famine have produced the worst rates of hunger and disease in southern Somalia two years. According to local authorities, at least 10 people die each day in the Bakol region of southwestern Somalia. Yarow is the second aid group official slain by gunmen in recent weeks.

India's most techno-savvy politician is a poor farmer's son who loves his laptop, has been feted by Bill Gates, hates red tape -- and won a landslide election victory in his home province. Nara Chandrababu Naidu, 49, has endeared himself to India's businessmen, especially technology companies, with his vision to transform Andhra Pradesh, one of India's poorest states, into a high-tech hub where far-flung districts are wired by high-speed data links. Naidu has made sweeping reforms to loosen the bureaucracy's tight control on the state government, lured big infrastructure projects, introduced a paperless administration to cut red tape and encouraged innovative development programs. When the World Bank cut off aid to India in May 1998 after New Delhi's multiple nuclear tests, it still gave Naidu's state a $560 million loan, impressed by his plans for health care.

Calling child poverty a hidden, ``slow-motion national disaster,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley offered a $9.8 billion prescription today to lift family incomes through automatic, annual increases in the minimum wage and expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. He also proposed new government programs to recruit 60,000 teachers into poor school districts and give children an after-hours school hangout seven days a week. ``If we do not look to raise the poorest children among us we have no heart. And if we do not nourish the spirit of our children, we have no soul,'' Bradley told teachers, students and social workers at a Brooklyn church. An estimated 13.5 million American children live in poverty, defined by the government as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for a family of four. That population has shrunk from 15.3 million when President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took office in 1993. ``Child poverty is a kind of slow-motion national disaster,'' Bradley said. ``We don't see it because it is usually hidden.''

A formal announcement is expected Tuesday, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified. With Colombia embroiled in a nasty civil war and serving as the principal cocaine source in U.S. markets, the administration has made the country its No. 1 priority in Latin America. It already ranks third in overall U.S. military assistance, and the new program is expected to raise American involvement there to new heights. The overall aid package for the current fiscal year is about $300 million. Although details were sketchy Monday night, the bulk of the program is expected to be geared toward assisting Colombia's counter-narcotics program, with some funds earmarked for military forces assigned to protect anti-drug police units. Additional funds are will be used to encourage Colombian farmers to develop crops other than coca leaf and other narcotics plants. There also will be money for protection of human rights workers and the training of judges and prosecutors as part of an ambitious judicial reform program. Steps also will be taken to revitalize the country's moribund economy, now in its worst recession in decades.\n",

China sees the key to its future success in its west: an inland expanse of deserts, Himalayan highlands and rugged, overfarmed mountains that is home to most of its poor. Driven by fears that the widening gap between its relatively affluent east and the backward, poverty stricken west could inflame social unrest and slow overall national development, the communist leadership has dusted off its perennial campaign to channel more investment into the hinterlands. That, the leadership contends, is the only way China can shake off endemic poverty and foster national economic growth. ''The population is large, the land is cheap, and the natural resources are plentiful,'' Zeng Peiyan, China's economic planning minister, said Monday. ''With our diligence, and that of the whole country, we can build a western region with a flourishing economy and beautiful mountains and rivers.'' The blueprint calls for vast increases in government spending on basic infrastructure and on luring foreign and domestic investment westward.

A Massachusetts law against doing business with Myanmar because of its poor human rights record has confronted the U.S. Supreme Court with a fundamental constitutional question: Can state and local governments make their own foreign policy? A federal judge and an appeals court have said no, and Massachusetts has appealed to the nation's highest court. As the justices hear the case Wednesday, cities and states with similar laws and activist groups will be watching closely. ''More and more people who are becoming interested in grassroots influence on international affairs and human rights issues see this may be a turning point in the techniques they will be able to use,'' said state Rep.

The United States and other countries have restricted aid since thousands of protesters were gunned down in a 1988 pro-democracy uprising. Four years ago -- while U.S. policy still allowed trade with Burma -- Massachusetts lawmakers barred the state from buying goods and services from companies that do business with Myanmar -- unless there is no other comparable bid.

The House voted 239-186 to reject an effort by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., that would have delayed, and perhaps eventually killed, $522 million of the Colombia aid. The roll call came after House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who rarely joins floor debate, took to the well of the chamber to ask colleagues for the full amount of money. Hastert, whose staunch support for the aid for Colombia has helped keep the overall bill alive, said the money was crucial for controlling the drug problem in the United States. U.S. officials say 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin used in the United States comes from Colombian-grown coca. ''We can't ignore this issue,'' Hastert said. ''We can't ignore it in this Congress, we can't ignore it on our street corners, and we can't ignore it in the place where this stuff comes from.''

The U.S. State Department has condemned the Islamic government for its ties to terrorism, its conduct of a civil war and its inaction on famine. The Corzine campaign refuted the charge in a news statement, claiming that the financing of Talisman Energy of Canada provided no direct benefit to the government of Sudan. The Corzine campaign also issued a counterpunch, saying that when Florio was a senior partner at the Mudge Rose law firm, it represented the Philippine government and a trade association in Columbia, two nations the Corzine campaign linked with child labor and anti-union violence. Florio campaign aide Walter Fields did not deny the claims of the Corzine campaign and said he had no specific response to it.

His comments came in a meeting of the council on improving the United Nations' ability to intervene early to help prevent wars -- something widely seen as a good idea but that stirs deeply held beliefs about sovereignty for Russia and China when the issue of military intervention arises.

The White House released a transcript of his message to Colombians a day before Clinton visits the South American country Wednesday. Eighty percent of the cocaine and most of the heroin that now makes its way to the United States comes from Colombia, where traffickers seek protection from Marxist guerrillas and right wing paramilitaries that are undermining a fragile government led by President Andres Pastrana.

In his address, which will be televised, Clinton called the American aid as ''both pro-peace and anti-drug.'' He also highlighted money in the package earmarked to support human rights, improvements in the Colombian judicial system and economic development, including money to help farmers start growing legal crops.

Whatever emerges is likely to be far smaller than the 10-year, $792 billion GOP package that Clinton vetoed last year. _Minimum wage: Republicans have offered to accept a White House-backed plan to boost the $5.15 minimum wage by $1 in two stages by Jan. 1, 2002.

The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday gave the Taliban a month to hand over bin Laden and to close terrorist training camps _ or suffer new sanctions.

      "S. Korea Donated $114M to the North. South Korea more than doubled its aid to North Korea last year as relations on the divided peninsula thawed, giving $114 million, Seoul officials said Thursday. North Korea has depended on foreign aid to feed its people since 1995. Its economy is in shambles with its farm industry crumbling, aggravated by years of floods and other natural disasters. By the North's own figures, about 220,000 people died of starvation and hunger-related diseases in the communist country in the early and mid 1990s. Seoul's aid to North Korea was a dramatic leap from the $47 million it gave in 1999. The South's contribution also made up around the total $220 million given last year by the international community. The other top donors were Japan, the United States and the European Union.\n",

      "World Bank: Nations Need Safety Nets. Improving government social safety nets can help make globalization work for poor countries and provide more security for their people, the World Bank said in a report Wednesday. But social protection must move beyond being a rescue system and provide individuals with a chance to escape from poverty more permanently, the report said. ``Safety nets are vital to catch people who lose their jobs, become hungry or sick,'' said Eduardo Doryan, the World Bank's vice president for human development and Costa Rica's former education minister. ``But a system that concentrates on helping poor people deal with the crisis once it happens runs the risk of keeping them in a poverty trap by not providing any opportunities,'' he said. To combat many developing countries' view that safety nets are a measure of last resort, Doryan called for an approach that makes social protection ``more like a springboard that lets people jump into more secure lives.''\n",

      "Report Warns of Loan Pitfalls. Add ``conditionality'' to the buzz word junkyard. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund say making developing countries in Africa jump through too many hoops to get money doesn't work. The bank said Tuesday in a new report that these countries are unlikely to adopt reforms to stimulate their economies and reduce poverty unless governments and their peoples broadly support the need for change. In development economics this is called ``country ownership,'' and David Dollar, the co-author of the bank's report said, ``conditionality cannot be a substitute for commitment. Reform has to be home grown.'' Dollar said governments receiving aid welcome a modest amount of conditions _ stabilizing exchange rates or fostering development of an independent judicial system _ but imposing dozens of them is largely ineffective. Lawmakers in the United States and other industrialized countries and international relief groups have long been critical of the bank and its sister institution, the IMF, for imposing a laundry list of conditions on poor countries to qualify for loans.\n",

President Bush urged Congress on Monday to grant him broad powers to negotiate trade deals, calling the barrier-free exchange of goods a ``moral imperative'' that would spread democracy, prosperity and human rights across the globe. ``I urge the Congress to restore our nation's authority to negotiate trade agreements and I will use that authority to build freedom in the world, progress in our hemisphere and enduring prosperity in the United States,'' Bush told the Council of the Americas, a hemispheric business group. Later this week, the president plans to formally ask Congress to give him the authority to negotiate trade deals that could be voted up or down by lawmakers without changes. Presidents from Ford to Clinton had such ``fast-track'' authority, but it lapsed during the Clinton administration. ``By failing to make the case for trade, we've allowed a new kind of protectionism to appear in this country,'' Bush said. ``It talks of workers, while it opposes a major source of new jobs. It talks of the environment, while opposing wealth-creating policies that will pay for clean air and water in developing nations. It talks of the disadvantaged, even as it offers ideas that would keep many of the poor in poverty.'' ``Open trade is not just an economic opportunity,'' Bush said, ``it is a moral imperative.''\n",

The 11th annual Human Development Report, scheduled to be released in Mexico City on Tuesday, found that the world's richest countries are holding back scientific breakthroughs key to eradicating hunger and stamping out poverty. ``The current debate in Europe and the United States over genetically modified crops mostly ignores the concerns of the developing world,'' the report says, adding that crops altered to produce higher yields could revolutionize farming in Africa, Latin America and across the underdeveloped world. It further argues that the developed world's push to cap technology once widely available has hurt the world's poor, highlighting how the campaign to ban DDT has left tropical countries battling a new breed of Malaria-carrying mosquitos. The report also faults wealthy nations for driving up international prices of prescription drugs by refusing to pay their share of high prices.\n",

We welcome the New African Initiative, which is based on the principles of responsibility and ownership, with an emphasis on democracy, transparency, good governance, rule of law and human rights as fundamental factors of development. This initiative provides the basis for a new intensive partnership between Africa and the developed world. Significant progress has been made on conflict resolution in several parts of Africa. In many places, however, conflict remains a major obstacle to economic and social development. We urge continued commitment to conflict prevention, management and resolution by the international community in partnership with African governments, the African Union and sub-regional organization. We continue to support the consolidation of democracy, pluralism and electoral fairness in an increasing number of African countries. We encourage similar progress towards political openness where democratic principles and the rule of law are weak. We also stress the importance of working in partnership with African governments to improve access of African products to world markets, attract foreign direct investment and promote investment in key social sectors, in particular health and education. Implementing the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative will release resources for such expenditure. We have decided today to forge a new partnership to address issues crucial to African development. We are committed to promoting this objective with our African partners and in multilateral fora _ in the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, and in a new round of WTO negotiations.

About 10,000 workers _ some claiming better times under communism _ marched Thursday through the Romanian capital to protest poverty, low wages and pensions, and corruption in national politics. ``More than a decade since the (1989) anti-Communist uprising, Romania is among the last in Europe in living standards and attracting foreign investment,'' said Bogdan Hossu, head of the Alfa Cartel, a union which organized the ``demonstration against poverty.'' The Alfa Cartel, one of the main trade unions in the country, accused Romania's political class of corruption and of impeding economic development by passing chaotic and inconsistent laws. The protesters stopped in front of the government headquarters in downtown Bucharest to call for the government to resign. They chanted ``Thieves,'' ``Down with Corruption,'' and ``Ceausescu, where are you?'' in reference to former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The union called for tax relief, and for raising pensions and wages to catch up with inflation. The protesters also asked the government to lower utilities prices.\n",

Afghanistan's fast approaching bitter winter could leave up to 100,000 Afghan children dead in the next few weeks, an international relief organization said as aid workers on Monday battled for more supplies and to immunize needy Afghans to prevent the spread of epidemics. ``Winter is approaching fast and we need to move in emergency supplies even quicker in order to help the most vulnerable, the Afghan children and women, to survive these very cold conditions,'' UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Thomas McDermott, told reporters in Tehran. A UNICEF report given to reporters Monday estimated that up to 100,000 children in refugee camps and cities inside Afghanistan could die of cold, disease and hunger if essential relief supplies are not made available in the next few weeks. McDermott, in Iran to oversee UNICEF's Iran-based emergency operations in Afghanistan, said the relief organization's priorities in Afghanistan were to conduct an ``immunization program to prevent the spread of epidemic diseases, reactivate social services and getting Afghan children back to school.'' Epidemic diseases spreading through Afghan refugee camps near Iran have claimed the lives of hundreds of children in the past few weeks.\n",

A U.N. conference to assess the progress of a program to reduce land-based pollution of oceans and coastal areas began with warnings of increasing damage. A report submitted Monday to the U.N. Environment Program's five-day conference called for ``urgent action'' to address the most serious problems associated with land-based activities such as sewage and destruction of habitat. The report by marine scientists blamed environmental damage of coasts and seas on poverty, poorly managed social and economic development, and unsustainable consumption patterns. The conference is the first full review of the Global Program of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities _ a November 1995 agreement by 108 governments and the European Union to protect and preserve the coastal and marine environment. The program of action calls for preventing or controlling land-based activities that produce sewage, heavy metals, radioactive substances, sediment and other waste materials harmful to oceans and coastal areas.\n",

Robinson was in the Danish capital as part of a global appeal for dlrs 2.5 billion to supply humanitarian aid to more than 30 million victims of the world's wars and natural disasters. ``An effective sanction is if there are extra-judicial killings or torture of prisoners or attacks on civilians that leaders who commit them should not be included in the broad-based administration that will take place under U.N. auspices,'' Robinson said. ``They should be disqualified basically.''\n",

Bush was speaking a day after the World Bank put out a report that showed developing countries are more likely to rebound from the global economic slowdown faster than richer nations, but still are not likely to experience rapid reductions in overall poverty. The bank has called for the United States and other wealthy nations to double the current $50 billion in foreign aid they provide to poor countries by $10 billion a year hikes over the next five years.

A powerful earthquake devastated villages in the Hindu Kush mountains of northern Afghanistan, where Afghan officials estimated that 1,800 people had died and thousands more were injured in a region already hard-hit by drought, war and food shortages. Aid agencies at the scene, however, estimated the death toll to be much lower. Ros O'Sullivan, project coordinator from Concern Worldwide, said aid workers believe 200 people were killed in the town of Nahrin and surrounding villages. The toll could go somewhat higher, he said, as the situation in isolated, outlying areas was still unknown. Aid agencies do not expect the toll to go higher than ``the low hundreds,'' O'Sullivan said Wednesday. That conclusion was reached Tuesday night during a meeting of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the International Organization for Migration, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Concern Worldwide, and other aid groups that had workers on the scene of the quake. U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said confusion over the toll is common in the early stages of disasters such as this, especially in remote areas where communication is poor and where people who flee are often initially reported as missing or dead. ``That's why we were very careful'' about giving out figures, he said.\n",

An internationally renowned economist denied Monday that he had helped ex-president Alberto Fujimori plot a closure of Congress and the courts to seize dictatorial powers 10 years ago.

A congressional investigator said over the weekend that Fujimori's ex-spy chief and top adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, who is now jailed on dozens of corruption charges, had testified that de Soto helped devise the coup. De Soto told the Radioprogramas radio station that Fujimori's government had contacted him three weeks after the coup for help in dealing with the international rejection of the measure.

The United States may cut off aid to India if government-backed lenders seize assets owned by a failed Enron Corp. subsidiary and Washington is forced to compensate the company's U.S. investors, a senior U.S. official said Monday. Indian lenders to the project are holding closed-door talks Monday and Tuesday to discuss a possible seizure of two power plants in western India owned by Dabhol Power Corp, Dow Jones Newswires said. Dabhol's Indian lenders are keen to find a buyer for the plants and have threatened to take over its assets if Enron doesn't cooperate in selling off the company's 85 percent foreign-held equity. Bankrupt Enron owns a 65 percent controlling stake, while General Electric Co. and construction firm Bechtel Corp. each own 10 percent. In response, Washington may invoke the Hickenlooper Amendment requiring the withholding of development aid to countries that have nationalized the property of U.S. citizens without paying for it, Dow Jones Newswires quoted a U.S. official in New Delhi as saying. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. In January, the three U.S. companies filed an intention to seek dlrs 200 million in compensation from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. for an expropriation of their stakes in the Dabhol project in western Maharashtra state, India's largest foreign investment.\n",

      "Third earthquake in two months kills dozens in northern Afghanistan. Afghanistan's third earthquake in less than two months jolted the north of the country Friday, killing dozens of people, injuring more than 100 and flattening an entire village, officials said. The quake brought down part of a mountain near Khost Freng, blocking a valley road in the Hindu Kush mountains, state television reported. The village about 170 kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital, Kabul, is near the site of a devastating March 25 quake that killed up to 1,000 people. State television, quoting the Interior Ministry, put the death toll from Friday's temblor at at least 50 with about 150 others injured, all in three nearby villages. Some private aid agencies put the death toll at more than 30. Wide disparities in casualty figures from natural disasters are common in Afghanistan because of poor communications, inefficient local administration and the custom of burying the dead quickly before accurate counts can be compiled. Aid workers said most of the casualties were in Doabi, a village of around 3,000 people some 140 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of Kabul.\n",

Aid groups say many thousands of children and adults across the country have died from hunger-related illnesses since the crisis began last year, and they predict the situation will get far worse without immediate international aid. It did not have to be this bad. While it was bad weather that destroyed the corn harvest here over the last two years, it was government mismanagement, poorly timed agricultural reforms and the disastrous sale of Malawi's emergency grain reserve that turned a crisis into a near disaster, according to international aid workers, Western diplomats and even some government officials.\n",

      "U.N. survey says women in Asia suffer due to gender inequalities. Women across Asia have fewer opportunities to advance socially and economically than men, partly due to violence against them, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission said Tuesday. ``Women tend to fare poorly in relative terms compared with men, even at the household level,'' an ESCAP statement said, citing a report to be released at the agency's 58th annual session Wednesday. It said violence against women, including wife-beating and forced sex within a marriage, and the trafficking of women and girls contributed to women's poverty in the region. Up to 225,000 women and girls are trafficked in the region annually, the agency said. Asian countries must adopt ``stronger legal frameworks and laws to combat human trafficking'' and focus on social rights issues such as land ownership rights to enable women to legally claim property. Gender discrimination in primary and secondary school education, however, has lessened significantly in many parts of Asia, ESCAP said.\n",

Egyptian and foreign human rights groups said the law is an attempt to further restrict already embattled independent associations.

In Kananaskis, the leaders also expect to discuss a proposal under which the United States would spend dlrs 10 billion over 10 years to develop programs to improve control over the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The plan calls for each of the other G-8 nations_ the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia_ to match the U.S. spending, and White House officials said Bush hopes to announce progress on those contributions. To raise the curtain, Bush announced a pair of Africa initiatives this week.

In total, about 10 million people in the region are facing food shortages after harvests were destroyed by drought, floods and economic instability. The hunger crisis  _  not the first one in the region  _  has been complicated by the AIDS epidemic, as well as by what aid workers say was poor management of grain reserves and land reforms. The U.N. food agency's interventions include assisting thousands of drought-affected families to grow crops, distributing maize and bean seeds, hand tools and fertilizers.     _  _  _\n",

      "European Union expands travel ban on Zimbabwean officials. The European Union on Monday widened its travel ban on senior Zimbabwean officials to punish President Robert Mugabe's government for human rights abuses, diplomats said. EU foreign ministers added 52 officials and their spouses  _ including Grace Mugabe, the president's wife  _  to the list of political, business and military figures banned from entering the union's 15 member states. The European assets of those on the list will also be frozen, diplomats said. The EU imposed targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe in February after Mugabe refused to let European observers monitor disputed elections that were held in March. The sanctions cut off 128 million euros (dollars) in development aid, banned Mugabe and 20 of his government ministers from traveling to EU countries and froze their assets in Europe. German Deputy Foreign Minister Juergen Chrobog said that while the food situation was dire across much of southern Africa\t_  in part because of poor weather, but also because of the AIDS epidemics and economic mismanagement\t_  Zimbabwe was an exception.\n",

North Korea has raised rice prices by up to 50 times and is boosting salaries, but aid workers can't tell yet whether the fledgling economic reforms will help relieve chronic hunger, a senior U.N. official said Monday. Kenzo Oshima, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, spent four days last week in the isolated North. But he said that even after meeting Cabinet ministers, his information about the market-oriented changes was ``still sketchy.'' North Korea has released few details but told diplomats last month it was introducing elements of a market economy into one of the most tightly controlled communist systems. Higher food prices could channel more money to farmers, encouraging them to produce more. ``The aim appears to be to boost production,'' said Oshima, the highest-ranking aid official to visit the North this year.

Trade barriers and subsidies used by the United States and Europe were blamed by Latin American officials for a failure to come to grips with the 54 million people the United Nations says are malnourished in the region. ``We can't compete with the treasury of other countries,'' Costa Rica's agriculture minister, Rodolfo Coto Pacheco, said at a U.N. hunger forum Monday at the Inter-American Development Bank. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has set of goal of cutting world hunger in half by 2015, including in Africa were 14.4 million people in six countries face starvation. In recent weeks, however, the agency has expressed doubt about its ability to reduce famine substantially, blaming in part a controversy that has arisen over genetically engineered crops from seeds produced in abundance by the United States but rejected by several African governments. But it was U.S. and European trade policies that agriculture officials from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia and other Latin American countries blamed for compounding poverty and hunger in rural areas of their countries, citing as an example a drop in export prices of coffee to 50 cents a pound.\n",

Following requests from world's poorest countries, the European Union's head office Tuesday proposed to end the practice of tying aid to conditions which benefit the donor country economically. In its proposal, the European Commission advocates the ``complete untying of food aid,'' to countries needing emergency handouts. ``Untying of aid is an important factor in improving both the effectiveness and coherence of pro-poor development policy,'' said Poul Nielson, the EU's development policy commissioner, adding that the 15-nation bloc has already untied aid handouts ``to a high degree for more than 25 years.'' Under traditional practices, European countries, as well as other Western nations, gave financial aid to poorer countries on condition that they used it to purchase goods and services from the donor country. Recipient countries and non-governmental organizations have long argued however, that tying aid would render the aid given ineffective as many poorer countries were forced to pay for things that would do little to improve their situation.\n",

In a speech in Garanhuns, close to his native town of Caetes and about 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Silva said his background as the son of a poor, illiterate mother makes him suited to finding solutions to poverty. ``Drought is a problem of nature, but misery is the fault of irresponsible politicians, who governed this country,'' Silva was quoted as saying by O Globo news Website. One of his first actions in government will be to give his ministers a firsthand view of the problem by flying them to the semiarid northeastern region and the hunger-stricken Jequitinhonha valley in Minas Gerais state, he said. ``My ministers need to see a hungry child and get to know the drought to be sensitive when taking decisions for Brazil,'' Silva said.\n",

The government announced Monday that it would set minimum wages for farm laborers as from next year, saying the measure was necessary to protect one of the country's most exploited groups of workers. On average, farm laborers earned 544 rand ($58) a month last year, but some took home as little as 200 rand ($22). As from March next year farm laborers would have to be paid at least 800 rand ($86) a month in wealthy areas, and 650 rand ($70) in poorer regions, Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said. These amounts could be reduced slightly by farmers who gave their workers food and accommodation. Mdladlana said the fact that many farm workers were poverty stricken clearly illustrated the need for a minimum wage, but the government recognized that if the level was set too high jobs would be lost.\n",

Spain's population of 40 million owes virtually all of its growth in recent years to immigrants, and now has more people over age 65 than under 16. The new aid  _\t100 euros per child under three  _  goes only to women with formal, open-ended labor contracts, whereas many workers in Spain have temporary ones or none at all and get paid under the table. Also, in order to be eligible a woman must pay into the social security system at least 100 euros a month, the same amount the government is now giving back.\n",

Castro said the concerns include school-going pupils from areas severely affected by food shortage at the peak of the famine between December 2001 and February 2002. Others in need include HIV/AIDS patients and the chronically ill and people in areas affected by natural disasters such as floods and landslides.\n",

      "Australia to begin contentious aid talks with Papua New Guinea. Australia's foreign minister said Tuesday he will visit impoverished Papua New Guinea this week to discuss how the Pacific island state administers aid from Canberra. Downer's announcement came on the 28th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence from Australia, which controlled the country until 1975. His statement was conciliatory, congratulating it on its achievements since independence. The trip on Wednesday and Thursday is to ``discuss how Australian assistance can best meet the development challenges facing Papua New Guinea,'' Downer said. A sprawling nation of 5 million people, Papua New Guinea is Canberra's largest aid recipient. Despite huge mineral reserves, it is plagued by social problems generated by poor political leadership, bad economic management and corruption. But the issue of aid has created deep friction between wealthy Australia and its bankrupt northern neighbor.\n",

      "focuses on more than just terrorism. For many poor countries in Latin America, security is about more than just terrorism. There's the battle against poverty, disease, the environment and natural disasters. That's the challenge facing the 34 active members of the Organization of American States as they attempt to hammer out a new security agenda during a two-day meeting starting Monday. But most agree the group will be hard-pressed to make sweeping changes, as the United States focuses on protecting the world against terrorists. ``It's probably the worst moment to try to find common ground in the hemisphere,'' Mexico City-based security analyst Ana Maria Salazar said. For years, Mexico and other countries in the West have wanted to expand the concept of hemispheric security beyond the military definitions of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, or so-called Rio Treaty, which calls on the American nations to defend each other from outside attacks. Many view the document as an outdated relic of the Cold War that allowed the United States to fight communists in Latin America in the late '60s, '70s, and '80s. One factor animating the developing countries is their recent success in helping thwart the industrialized nations' global agenda at the World Trade Organization talks last month in Cancun. Fueled by that victory, they could push ahead for their own interests at the security level as well.\n",

Silva made the comments at a campsite set up by the protesters near the presidential palace. Following the speech, the president's office released details of the government's land reform program. Under the plan, the administration will give landless farm workers some government-controlled land and some properties to be expropriated from major landowners. Under Brazil's 1988 Constitution, the federal government may seize farm properties officially designated as ``nonproductive'' and then distribute them to poverty-stricken rural workers. The government can also purchase lands for distribution to the rural poor. The plan announced Friday calls for settlement of 400,000 rural families onto new family farms by 2006. The plan will also issue deeds to 500,000 families settled under previous land reform programs who never received official title to their land.\n",

In a declaration adopted by 189 countries, the leaders promised to cut in half the proportion of people living on less than one dollar a day, and people who do not have safe drinking water, by the year 2015. They also pledged to provide universal primary school education by 2015, improve the lives of slum dwellers, halt or reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, close the so-called digital divide between the poor and the wealthy, and work to improve the environment.

The British government on Wednesday urged greater international efforts to tackle global poverty and warned that without more money and political will, United Nations development goals would not be met. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who is Britain's Treasury chief, called for further international commitment to debt relief for the world's poorest countries, and to fairer trade. Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair, have made tackling poverty in Africa a priority for Britain's presidency of the Group of Eight industrial countries and the European Union next year. Brown told a development conference sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corp. and the government that the goals of the U.N.'s 2000 Millennium Summit _ to reverse the poverty, hunger and disease affecting billions of people by 2015 _ would not be met without urgent action. \"In 2000 every world leader signed up, every international body signed up, almost every single country signed up,\" Brown said. \"This commitment was a bond of trust, perhaps the greatest bond of trust pledged between rich and poor. But already, so close to the start of our journey, we can see that our destination risks becoming out of reach, receding into the distance.\"\n",

      "Cambodian NGOs demand action against rampant corruption. PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The Cambodian government must make real progress to clean up rampant corruption that fills the pockets of the rich at the expense of the poor, human rights advocates demanded Tuesday. At a forum of non-governmental organizations, more than 150 rights workers told the government to stop putting off pledges of reform and to stamp out graft, which threatens to choke off crucial foreign aid to the country. \"(Cambodia) is producing a two-tier society that is increasing inequality by making the rich richer and the poor even poorer,\" a statement from the forum said. Some 43 percent of Cambodia's 13 million people live on US$1 (euro0.76) or less a day. \"(The government) needs to take strong action to rid Cambodia's courts of corruption, and ensure that police, military and government officials are held accountable and no longer protected from the law,\" the statement said.\n",

      "China's newly rich, bitterly poor dig deep for tsunami aid. At the Chinese Red Cross, volunteer Zhao Zhengang's phone rang nonstop with more than 1,500 calls from people wanting to donate money for survivors of southern Asia's deadly earthquake and tsunamis. The calls came not just from China's newly rich entrepreneurs, but from pensioners, children and migrant workers, said Zhao. The outpouring of private aid _ as blanket coverage by state media shows victims' suffering _ is unprecedented in China, where giving to charity is still rare and donations for disasters abroad are almost unknown. \"We all live in the same world and our economic situation is better now than it was, and our standard of living has improved, so now is the time,\" Zhao said Tuesday. Though the communist government hopes China will be seen as a major Asian leader, its official donation of 500 million yuan (US$60 million; euro45 million) ranks it in seventh in the world in the region behind No. 1 donor Japan _ regarded by Beijing as a rival for regional superpower status.\n",

      "Tsunami pledges are in, now the world must pay up, aid groups say. The outpouring of aid pledges for victims of the Asian tsunami has been huge. But donors have failed to make good on their promises after some past disasters, and aid groups say they will keep the pressure on to make sure the help announced with such great fanfare doesn't evaporate. World leaders gathered in the Indonesian capital this week vowed they'd stand by survivors for the long haul. Nearly US$4 billion (euro3 billion) has been promised so far. It's reminiscent, on a larger scale, of donors' promises of more than US$1 billion (euro750 million) after an earthquake killed 26,000 people in Bam, Iran. A year later, Iran says it's only gotten US$17.5 million (euro13 million). In Central America, the story was the same after Hurricane Mitch roared through in 1998. The aid group Oxfam says payments fell US$2 billion (euro1.5 billion) short of promises. And critics chide U.S. President George W. Bush for failing to win full funding for his Millennium Challenge Account program to help poor countries that are trying to open markets promote democracy and abide by human rights standards. He promised US$4 billion (euro3 billion) for 2005, then asked Congress for US$2.5 billion (euro1.9 billion) and got US$1.5 billion (euro1.1 billion).\n",

The European Union called for a rapid global reconstruction effort to follow up the millions of euros (dollars) in emergency relief flowing to Asian countries hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami. A hastily arranged meeting of EU foreign, health and development ministers on Friday also agreed to accelerate studies on the creation of an EU rapid-response team for disasters that could include doctors, nurses, engineers, military personnel and other relief workers. In a statement, the ministers deplored the high death toll, which stands at some 150,000, and includes hundreds of Europeans. The EU ministers agreed they would move to quickly approve more aid announced by the EU head office and said they would work for a \"rapid and coordinated\" international long-term reconstruction effort. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country holds the EU presidency, said the union had to \"match the generosity of our population and ensure aid is efficient and sustainable.\"\n",

Small island nations need help dealing with environmental and economic woes that are threatening their survival, a senior official said. The world should not forget helping the vulnerable island nations even as it rushes aid to people affected by last month's tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Paul Berenger told a United Nations conference on the future of small island developing states. \"While every effort should be made to bring most urgent assistance to the victims of such disasters, we should not lose sight of other important aspects of the development of (small islands),\" Berenger said Monday. The five-day conference is expected to press the international community to help island nations in the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean deal with threats from tsunamis, rising sea levels, falling development aid, mounting trade loses and HIV/AIDS. Traditional donors have cut annual development aid to small island nations from US$2.3 billion (euro1.74 billion) to US$1.7 billion (euro1.29 billion) over the last decade, according to U.N. figures.\n",

Foreign aid workers will have to take army escorts to most of Indonesia's tsunami-stricken Aceh province because of the threat of attacks by rebels, the military said Thursday. The United Nations said the move could create bottlenecks in aid deliveries. Moreover, the military said it was short of troops to escort relief workers _ further heightening fears aid groups won't be reach many areas where hundreds of thousands of survivors are in desperate need of assistance. Aid workers said they've had no security problems in Aceh. Rebel leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to a cease-fire they declared hours after the Dec. 26 massive earthquake near Aceh sent killer waves fanning out across the Indian Ocean, killing more than 150,000 people in 11 nations. Indonesia's moves _ which include an order that aid workers declare their travel plans or face expulsion _ highlight its sensitivities over foreign military involvement in a humanitarian effort and underscore its efforts to regain control of Aceh province, the scene of a decades-old conflict between separatist rebels and federal troops accused of human rights abuses. Security fears have also restricted aid deliveries in Sri Lanka, where Tamil rebels have accused Indian and U.S. forces of spying.\n",

Millennium Project. A 1970 goal for developed nations to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national income to development aid is today met by only five nations _ Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Only six others _ Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Spain and Britain _ are on record as saying they will reach that target by 2015. And even if the bar is lowered to 0.44 percent of GNI, the report says, many wealthy U.N. members including the United States, Germany and Japan still fall short of the mark.\n",

These should include free mass distribution of anti-malaria bed-nets and anti-malaria medicines for children, eliminating fees for primary school and essential health services, providing antiretroviral drugs to 3 million AIDS patients by the end of 2005, and providing free fertilizer for small farmers with poor soil by the end of 2006. _ Rich countries should increase development assistance from 0.25 percent of gross national income in 2003 to about 0.44 percent in 2006 and 0.54 percent in 2015 to support the Millennium Development Goals. Rich countries should reach the U.N. target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015, to support the millennium goals as well as other development priorities.\n",

Some business leaders are concerned, however, that such an increase is unsustainable. Blair has argued that low wages create a poverty trap, encouraging people to draw unemployment benefits rather than finding work. The issue is likely to figure prominently in national elections, with Labour reminding voters that the main opposition Conservative Party rejected the minimum wage in the 1997 election campaign.\n",

Unwanted infants are often abandoned in Kenya, with poverty and failed relationships frequently to blame.

The 60-year-old mason lost his zinc roof when Hurricane Ivan slammed into the tiny island in September. Slowed by a shortage of building materials and job commitments, he's racing to put up something stronger in time for the 2005 hurricane season, which officially began Wednesday. Still battered from an onslaught of catastrophic storms last year, Caribbean countries are bracing for another hurricane season that experts warn could bring more trouble to a region made vulnerable by lingering damage, poverty and environmental decay. The trail of destruction is most visible in hard-hit Grenada, where many children are taught in classrooms topped by plastic blue tarps, huge piles of discarded zinc roof tiles sit outside the wrecked national stadium and once vibrant nutmeg fields lay fallow. \"A lot of us (haven't) rebuilt yet and the season's already here,\" Simon said, as workers slid steel reinforcing rods into new rafters atop his small home outside the capital of St. George's. \"We saw what Ivan did so we don't want it to be as easy next time.\"\n",

Last year's Asian tsunami hit poor people far harder than the middle class and wealthy, and the aid effort could worsen the income gap in affected regions, a major aid group said Saturday. Nearly six months after the enormous Dec. 26 disaster, Oxfam said those aiding the survivors must work hard to reach out to the poor and help them build better lives than they had before. Just replacing the destroyed assets of landowners and businesspeople would leave behind those who owned little, and exacerbate the divide between rich and poor, the agency said. \"Desperately poor people have been made poorer still by the tsunami,\" said Oxfam's Britain director, Barbara Stocking. \"The generous response of the public has put us in a strong position to address these problems.

      "U.N.: Hardship for farmers is serious side effect of fall in Myanmar's opium production. Opium production in Myanmar dropped 26 percent in the past year, but the breakthrough in the fight against the drug comes amid growing concern that farmers who produced it are being forced into desperate poverty, the United Nations said Wednesday. \"The world will not condone counternarcotic measures that result in humanitarian disasters,\" Antonio Mario Costa, the executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, said in statement accompanying the release of its Myanmar Opium Survey 2005. Myanmar is the world's second biggest producer after Afghanistan of opium, from which heroin is made. The report said that Myanmar's total potential opium production in 2005 was estimated at 312 metric tons, down from 370 tons last year and a peak of 1,760 tons in 1986. More than half of the families surveyed in frontier regions where opium can be grown reported food shortages, and the numbers were higher in regions where opium cultivation had been common, said the report, produced with Myanmar's Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control. \"Some of the poorest people are being affected by the loss of income from drugs as cultivation declines,\" Costa said. \"They end up very vulnerable to exploitation and misery _ from human rights abuses to enforce the opium bans to internal displacement or human trafficking to survive the bans.\"\n",

Quake survivors massed in debris-strewn fields to pray and mark a normally joyous Muslim festival in a somber tone Friday as preachers called South Asia's devastating earthquake a test of faith and punishment for wrongdoing. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton urged Pakistan and India to set aside their rivalry, saying in New York that this would help prompt a world weary of big natural disasters to open purses once more for the more than 3 million people left homeless in the Oct. 8 quake centered in Pakistani Kashmir. In the regional hub of Muzaffarabad, the faithful gathered on straw mats in a field surrounded by smashed concrete as the helicopters of aid workers buzzed overhead in efforts to deliver much-needed aid ahead of the Himalayan region's fierce winter. \"God is testing us, testing our patience, testing our faith,\" Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest religious political party, told a crowd of more than 1,000 men. \"One of the main reasons for the earthquake was our wrongdoing.\" For most of Pakistan, Friday was the start of the Eid al-Fitr celebration marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, but President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who toured Muzaffarabad on Friday, has asked citizens throughout the country to tone down festivities out of respect for quake victims.\n",

Nomzamo Ngetu rests her cheek against the house of her dreams, tearfully marveling at how her life has been transformed by hundreds of Irish volunteers who have descended on her poor township for a veritable building blitz. After a lifetime spent in shacks that leak in the rain, blow down in the wind and are tinderboxes in the heat, Ngetu's extended family is set to move into a modest two-bedroom home with hitherto unimaginable luxuries: A bathroom, running water, electricity. \"This is my home.

Ngetu, who spent 18 years on the housing waiting list in the Imizamo Yethu township, is one of the beneficiaries of a campaign by 700 Irish volunteers to build 100 houses within the two weeks ending Saturday. It is reportedly the largest ever gathering of Irish charity workers for a single overseas event. The project, now in its third year, is the brainchild of Niall Mellon, a wealthy Irish property developer who was struck by the extremes of opulence and poverty in South Africa as it emerges from decades of white racist rule.

Bush a $20.9 billion (euro17.9 billion) measure for foreign policy programs and aid for poor nations, an increase of about $1 billion (euro850 million) from last year. The bill, which the Senate approved Thursday on a 91-0 vote, gives the president millions of dollars more than he sought for worldwide efforts to fight AIDS, but less money than he requested for Iraq reconstruction and a program to encourage global development. The House approved the bill last week. Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill. But the leading Senate Democrat on foreign aid issues, Patrick Leahy, raised concerns about provisions funding military training assistance for Indonesia. Leahy said the Indonesian army has not been held accountable for abuses committed during East Timor's campaign for independence in the 1990s. The aid bill also calls for a report on the status of an FBI investigation into the 2002 killings of two American school teacher and an Indonesian in Indonesia's West Papua province and another report on the humanitarian and human rights situation in West Papua.\n",

Medical teams, meanwhile, have moved into a new clinic built to isolate victims of a major dysentery outbreak at a crowded refugee camp in Muzaffarabad, the quake-shattered capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Hundreds of people had been hospitalized with severe dehydration as a result of poor hygiene in the camp, but new cases have since fallen to just a few dozen daily, medical workers said. The newly arrived British heavy-lift Chinooks join a fleet of about 80 helicopters being operated by a variety of governments and aid agencies in one of the biggest-ever helicopter airlifts of aid. The British choppers will fly nine-hour daily missions over the next three days, initially delivering 450 tons of tents, blankets, cooking supplies and mattresses to remote mountain villages that have been cut off by landslides.

The United Nations warned Tuesday that worsening economic conditions and rising rates of disease in Myanmar could eventually lead to a \"humanitarian crisis\" in the impoverished country. \"There is increasing poverty and people are having a harder time surviving,\" Charles Petrie, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Myanmar, told The Associated Press. Myanmar has always been one of the poorest countries in Asia, but its situation has become more precarious in recent months with the ruling junta's decision to increase fuel prices nine-fold. It has led to price increases for most consumer goods and many Myanmar people _ whose monthly salaries amount to little more than a few dollars _ say they barely have enough to eat. \"What we are seeing is a greater inability for families and communities to survive shock, whether it's natural shock such as tsunamis or economic shocks,\" he said. \"It is not a humanitarian crisis today but that doesn't mean it won't become one in the future.\" With little money for health care, the country has also become a hot spot for a range of infectious diseases, Petrie said. A majority of the malaria cases in Asia come from Myanmar, and cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis are on the rise, while more than a third of sex workers and intravenous drug-users are believed to be infected with HIV.\n",

Li travels next to Senegal, Mali, Liberia and two of Africa's leading oil producers, Nigeria and Libya, where he wraps up the trip Jan. 19, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan told reporters Tuesday in Beijing. China's rapidly growing hunger for resources has focused its attention on the African continent, rich in minerals and oil but deeply impoverished and keen to court the possibility of expanded Chinese aid. China has lavished attention on Africa for decades, making it the first overseas stop on the foreign minister's calendar every year. As China's involvement in Africa has grown, so have opportunities for political and economic friction with the West. Sudan, for example, is the subject of sanctions by some Western countries because of its human rights record. But China, which gets oil from Sudan, has blocked attempts at the U.N. to censure Sudan.

The reclusive leader this week concluded a nine-day trip through China's booming southern regions, the cradle of three decades of free-market reform that have made it one of the world's fastest growing economies. Although observers cautioned that Kim's totalitarian style leaves little room for change on the scale of China's reforms, his journey raised hopes that North Korea was contemplating more steps toward opening its economy. In theory, China is an enticing model for the North: a fellow communist state that has guided its economy down a largely capitalist path while keeping tight political control over its citizens. That balance could be what North Korea is seeking as it struggles to rehabilitate an economy devastated by mismanagement, natural disasters and the loss of aid following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n",

Other experts have echoed his concerns about drought's increasing frequency and severity on the world's poorest continent, blaming both changes in the weather pattern and Africans' diminishing ability to withstand crises because of AIDS, poor recovery from previous setbacks and other factors. \"I would argue that we are now entering a time of persistent famine\" in Africa, Calestous Juma, a development expert at Harvard University, said in a telephone interview. His homeland, Kenya, is experiencing its worst drought in a decade. Juma said the situation should put development on the agenda. He urged African governments to devote more resources _ including money saved thanks to debt relief initiatives in the West _ to telecommunications and transport infrastructure, technical training and boosting small and medium size-businesses.\n",

Droughts, floods, changing rain patterns and rising sea levels are threatening development efforts in the world's poorest countries, experts and aid workers said at an international water forum. Regions including Africa and South Asia _ home to most of the 1.1 billion people who live without clean water _ will be among the hardest hit by changing weather patterns, experts at the 4th World Water Forum said Monday. They blamed the threats largely on changes in the global climate. \"Droughts will worsen. We will see deforestation, forest fires, a loss of biodiversity and degradation of the environment,\" said Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization. \"The least developed countries are the most affected. Often, developing countries don't have the resources to mitigate the impact.\" Gana Unnayan Sangstha, an aid worker who helps install community water systems in Bangladesh's poor coastal province of Satkhira, said global warming is causing salt to get into ground water, rendering wells useless for drinking or irrigation. \"Bangladesh is the lowest-lying country in the world. There are salinity intrusions into larger areas due to climate change, and a rise in sea-water levels,\" he said.\n",

Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday called for aid to help combat the \"severe degradation\" of three-quarters of African farmland, a leading cause of hunger and poverty on the continent. Obasanjo's plea for aid came in tandem with the release of a study by the Alabama-based non-governmental International Center for Soil Fertility and Agriculture Development. The study found that continued stripping of nutrients from the soil in Africa will heighten poverty and famine there. \"Our quest is to nourish the African soil and feed the continent,\" said Obasanjo, who is also the chairman of the New Partnership for Africa's Development implementing committee, a planning arm of the African Union. \"Americans spend only about ten cents of each dollar on food, so they have 90 cents for other things, but in Africa many families spend three-quarters of their income on food.\" One in three Africans is undernourished in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, where the same plots of soil have been severely over-farmed to meet growing demand for food. Obasanjo said that by 2050, Africa's population will swell by a projected 1.3 billion people _ an increase that will further strain already inadequate resources. \"We need the strong support of the international development community,\" Obasanjo said at a news conference held at the Rockefeller Foundation, which sponsored the event.\n",

Nepal's poor record on human rights and democracy has forced a Swedish aid agency to withdraw its US$25 million (euro21 million) pledge for a drinking water project, officials said Tuesday. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency said it has withdrawn from the Melamchi drinking water project in central Nepal after its partner, Norway, pulled back last year, citing the political situation in Nepal. \"Norway motivated its decision with the negative developments in the areas of democracy and human rights in Nepal,\" Tomas Nystrom of the Swedish agency told The Associated Press from Stockholm. The project was to provide drinking water for 1.5 million inhabitants of the capital of Katmandu and surrounding areas, which have faced acute water shortages for years. \"We had a so-called silent partnership with Norway, meaning Norway handled the Swedish support on our behalf because Sweden does not have an aid office in Nepal,\" said Nystrom.\n",

North Korea is not capable of feeding its people and could face a repeat of the famine that killed up to 3 million people in the 1990s unless it changes its \"regressive\" food policies, a U.S. rights group warned Thursday. The communist state, which relied on foreign handouts for a decade to feed its 23 million people, decided late last year to reject international aid, resume a full-scale state distribution of food and ban the private sale of grain, saying it could feed itself with good harvests. The country also receives aid from South Korea and China, its main food donors. But New York-based Human Rights Watch said the decisions are ill-judged and are already showing signs of problems. \"Only a decade ago, similar policies led to the famine that killed anywhere from 580,000 to more than 3 million,\" the group said in a statement released to reporters in Seoul. \"Regressive policies ... could someday lead to a repeat of the food crisis in the 1990s.\" Natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, and mismanagement devastated the North's economy in the mid-1990s, prompting the communist regime to call for outside help.\n",

As West Africa heads again into its pre-harvest \"lean season,\" aid workers hoping to feed millions of hungry people say responding to the annual emergency isn't enough. In effect, development-minded officials want to put emergency-relief workers out of their jobs. They would rather encourage long-term development of West Africa's farms and boost incomes so even the poorest can afford to buy food in the markets all the year round. The emergency-relief people say that would be fine by them. \"We don't want to respond when it goes to red alert _ but two levels earlier,\" says Margie Morard, a food-security official for Oxfam Great Britain. For one thing, the emergency response often just doesn't work. Last year, a particularly insidious combination of poor rains and a plague of locusts obliterated crops across the sun-baked region just south of the Sahara Desert, particularly in the country of Niger. Despite months of calls by the United Nations' for help feeding millions of hungry people, aid only flooded in after camera crews beamed images of withered, severely malnourished babies around the world. By then, it was too late for many.\n",

U.S. military vehicles race through trash-strewn streets with their guns pointed into traffic. To many Afghans, foreigners are a privileged elite, earning hefty salaries and given to drinking alcohol while this shattered Islamic nation remains mired in violence and poverty. That divide helped stoke Monday's deadly anti-Western riots, the latest of several bouts of unrest that have wracked Afghanistan in the past year. The worst riots seen in Kabul for years began after a U.S. military truck whose brakes failed careered down a hill and plowed into cars at an intersection, killing at least one Afghan. Afghans generally are grateful to the U.S.-led military alliance for ousting the Taliban in 2001 and welcome help from international charities. But many residents also long to lift themselves out of poverty and take control of their destinies, more than four years after the downfall of the Taliban's strict Islamic rule. \"We don't want these foreigners, they should go home.

With ox-drawn hoes, the occasional tractor and armies of planters seeding the fields by hand, North Korea has mobilized its antiquated farm industry for the annual battle to fend off starvation. As the spring planting begins, the communist government insists that the famines of the 1990s are long past. But it is also seeking food aid from China, South Korea and the U.N.'s World Food Program, suggesting to foreign experts that once again the harvest will fall short. Last month, North Korea agreed with the WFP on a reduced feeding program to cover 1.9 million North Koreans, down from the 6.5 million the agency had previously fed. That may not be enough, the agency says. It warns of millions being at risk, such as urban workers who have no land on which to grow extra food, and no money to buy it.

Poor countries received US$250 billion from citizens working abroad last year, more than what they got in foreign direct investment and official aid, the World Bank says. World Bank researchers believe the unsung remittances have helped reduce poverty in many countries. They have cut the share of poor people by 11 percentage points in the East African nation of Uganda and by five in West Africa's Ghana, said Dilip Ratha, a senior economist at the World Bank and its expert on migration and remittances. Remittances are effective in curbing poverty because they \"are personal flows, and the flows take place at a personal level _ so they are better targeted ... to the needs of the recipients,\" Ratha said. \"It comes in small amounts, more frequently, can be stopped if you find there is misuse _ because of all these reasons, remittances are better targeted to the needs of the recipients\" than investments or aid. Remittances, unlike private capital, also often flow steadily, even during financial crisis, natural disasters or political conflict, he said. But \"a sizable amount of remittances, coming in times of need, can actually create a sense of complacency in the government and they might postpone important development steps, or economic reforms,\" he said.\n",

      "South Pacific leaders endorse Australian-led force in Solomons, but disputes continue. South Pacific leaders broke Wednesday from their most contentious summit in years, with Australia succeeding in keeping control of a security force in the Solomon Islands but being accused of colonial-style bullying. Disputes between Australia, the Solomons and Papua New Guinea dominated the annual meeting of the 16-member South Pacific Forum, overshadowing talks on economic development for the impoverished region and calls from low-lying states for more help to deal with rising sea levels. Forum leaders wrapped up two days of talks on Wednesday with no major announcements but general agreement on their plan to further integrate and develop their economies. The forum nations, a collection of mostly small and isolated island nations stretching across thousands of kilometers (miles) in the southern Pacific, rely heavily on foreign aid from Australia and New Zealand, fishing licensing from Asian countries including Japan, and aid from China and Taiwan, which bid for diplomatic recognition in the region. Canberra has recently stepped up warnings that the region is rent by corruption and poor governance that could stoke communal tensions and raise the prospect of failed states developing and becoming havens for terrorists and cross-border criminal activity.\n",

North Korean leader Kim Jong Il toured a fertilizer factory to urge increased production to help resolve food shortages, the country's state media reported Monday. South Korea has regularly provided fertilizer as part of its aid to the communist North, but those shipments have been suspended since the North test-fired a barrage of missiles in July over international objections. In response to Pyongyang's Oct. 9 nuclear test, Seoul said Monday it would keep aid shipments on hold. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim had visited a fertilizer factory and machine shop in South Hamgyong province. No date of the visit was given. \"Underlining the need to develop agriculture for the purpose of solving the food problem and increase the supply of fertilizers to the farms for better farming, he called for concentrating all efforts on the production of fertilizers,\" KCNA said of Kim's comments during the trip. The North has suffered from famine since the 1990s, due to the loss of its Soviet patron and natural disasters in addition to outdated farming practices. As many as 2 million people are believed to have died.\n",

      "China ' s parliament takes up measures to update property, tax laws. Parliament on Sunday took up measures meant to bring Chinese law into line with a more open, capitalist-style economy by protecting private property and equalizing taxes for foreign and domestic companies. The proposed property law is the most controversial measure to come before parliament in recent years. Earlier versions prompted an outcry by leftists, who complained it would undermine state control of the economy and worsen the growing gap between an elite who have profited from China's reforms and the poor majority. The National People's Congress began considering a seventh draft on Sunday that \"strikes a balance between private property and state ownership,\" said the official Xinhua News Agency. It said backers hoped to pass it when the NPC holds its next full meeting in March. The Communist Party amended the constitution in 2004 to enshrine private property rights for the first time since its 1949 revolution. That followed two decades of reform that let hundreds of millions of Chinese lift themselves out of poverty as entrepreneurs started businesses, bought homes and traded stocks. The debate over legal changes meant to enforce such protections highlights enduring concern about the impact of China's rapid but uneven growth, which has set off protests over poverty, taxes and seizures of farmland for redevelopment.\n",

A baby boom generation born in the early 1980's has reached marriage and childbearing age, putting China at risk of another massive population boom if the restrictions are dropped, said Zhang Weiqing, minister of the National Population and Family Planning Commission. Since the late 1970s, China has limited urban couples to one child and rural families to two children to control the population and conserve scarce natural resources. Beijing contends that the policy has helped prevent 400 million births and has aided rapid economic development. Zhang said many migrant workers have been found to be evading the birth restrictions, having two or more children despite living in cities where couples are only allowed to have one. He did not give specific figures.\n",

      "U.N. agency says food aid can depress market prices if timing is wrong or it ' s poorly targeted. Food aid can depress and destabilize market prices in recipient countries if the timing is wrong or if it is poorly targeted, a U.N. agency warned in a new report to be released Wednesday. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said that where food is available but vulnerable groups lack access to it, cash assistance or food vouchers are more effective and avoid undermining local markets. \"The State of Food and Agriculture 2006\" report, which will be presented at the agency's headquarters in Rome, also said that while emergency food aid is essential, it cannot by itself overcome the underlying social and economic causes of poverty and hunger, and warned donors to also address longer-term needs. The total number of chronically undernourished people in the world is estimated by FAO at 854 million, a number that has barely changed since the early 1990s. Of those, 61 percent live in Asia and the Pacific, while sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 24 percent. Food aid amounts to a relatively small number compared to global production and trade, averaging about 10 million tons per year. Until about a decade ago, most food aid was provided on a government-to-government basis and was sold on the open market in recipient countries. Now, about 75 percent of all food aid is targeted directly to hungry people through emergency operations or projects, FAO said.\n",

North Korea is facing one of its biggest food shortages in the past decade with millions of people going hungry because of a poor harvest and a huge drop in donor aid, a U.N. official said Wednesday. Anthony Banbury, the Asian regional director for the Rome-based World Food Program, who just returned from a six-day trip to North Korea, said officials there told him they faced a food gap of 1 million tons because of a bad harvest last year and a 75 percent fall in donor assistance. \"If donors do not respond to the request, millions of people are going to go hungry,\" Banbury told a news conference. North Korea has relied on foreign food aid since natural disasters and mismanagement devastated its economy in the mid-1990s and led to a famine estimated to have killed some 2 million people. But the secretive regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il restricted activities of aid agencies and pressed them to reduce the size of their foreign staffs in the country. The WFP suspended aid in December 2005 after North Korea claimed food supplies were adequate and asked it to switch focus to economic development.

Women and children are suffering most acutely from the emphasis on top-line economic figures, said the U.N. bodies for children, development and European economics. They did not examine the eight former communist countries that joined the European Union three years ago -- such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- but their studies did include new EU members Bulgaria and Romania. \"Too many children, women and families in rural areas of our region are not doing well,\" said Shahnaz Kianian-Firouzgar, a senior UNICEF official. \"They and their families are excluded from the current economic recovery.\" The agencies made their joint statement to publicize new U.N. data bringing together two decades of monitoring work in more than a dozen countries that made the difficult transition from state-controlled economy to the free market system after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Restructuring the bank is the hot topic at this year's conference. With extreme poverty projected to be all but wiped out in Asia within 15 years, the ADB is weighing how to address the needs of a wealthier region to remain relevant as one of the world's premier development agencies along with the World Bank. \"We should celebrate when countries no longer need ADB to finance their development needs, not seek ways to artificially create incentives to lend to them,\" Peel said, noting there is still work to be done in poverty eradication. Countries that have conquered poverty should turn instead to the private sector for capital and the ADB \"should step aside and declare victory,\" he said.

But until recently, his hardline government had not gone after natural coca products made by Indians, acknowledging that millions of peasants have chewed calcium-rich coca for thousands of years to stave off hunger and as a remedy for ailments from altitude sickness to stomach aches. Uribe's presidential Web site even promoted natural coca products as a rare commercial enterprise for poor Indian communities, and the federal food-safety agency provided quality-control advice to the manufacturers of coca tea, cookies, shampoo and other consumer goods. That suddenly changed in February, when Uribe's administration started banning the sale of coca products outside the reservations where Indians have a constitutional right to grow the hearty plant.

About 600 million people, or 15 percent of Asia's 4 billion population, still live on the poverty line, or on US$1 a day, the bank said. \"New approaches to promote agricultural and rural growth, along with innovative social protection measures, are needed to help the poor who have been left behind,\" von Braun said.\n",

      "Uganda to give monthly allowances to chronically poor. Uganda will pay a US$10 monthly allowance to the country's \"chronically poor\" who live on less than a dollar a day, officials said Thursday. The US$7.7 million program is being funded by Britain's Department for International Development and aid agencies including HelpAge International. A further US$6 will be given to families who support the elderly, disabled or orphans. \"We want to ensure that these vulnerable groups are developing at the same level as all other citizens of Uganda,\" Minister for Elderly and Disabled People Sulaiman Madada told The Associated Press. \"The allowance will put them on the first step of the ladder and allow them to move themselves forward.\" The three-year pilot scheme will start in 2008 and affect 9,000 households identified by community workers and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Madada said that the scheme is based on similar in countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique.\n",

Torrential rains in North Korea have forced thousands of families from their homes and left at least 200 people dead or missing, an aid official said Tuesday, adding that the worst floods there in a decade will worsen Pyongyang's already precarious ability to feed its people. To cope with damage from the storms that began last week, the North has asked the United Nations to assess the situation in affected regions as part of a preliminary request for assistance -- an indication of the dire situation in the impoverished nation. North Korea struggles to provide for its people and as many as 2 million people died from famine that began in the mid-1990s that the government blamed on natural disasters, but was also caused by outdated farming methods and the loss of the country's Soviet benefactor. Because of the food shortages, regular North Koreans seek to use all possible arable land in the mountainous country to grow food -- denuding vast hillsides of natural vegetation and therefore increasing the risk of landslides when heavy rains strike. In the latest floods that began last week, North Korean state media reported that \"hundreds\" were dead or missing, without giving further detail on casualties.\n",

If confirmed, the destruction so far to the country's agriculture would amount to about a quarter of the damage the North claimed it suffered in 1995. That disaster exacerbated a famine spawned by mismanagement of the economy and the loss of Pyongyang's Soviet benefactor after the fall of communism that eventually left as many as 2 million dead.

An international aid group has turned away US$46 million (euro34.32 million) in funding from the U.S. government, arguing the way American food aid is distributed hurts poor farmers. CARE said wheat donated by the U.S. government and sold by charities to fund anti-poverty programs destroys local agriculture by dumping low priced crops on the market and local farmers cannot compete. Other experts said they share CARE's concerns, but say different kinds of help suit different situations. \"We are not against emergency food aid for things like drought and famine,\" CARE's Atlanta-based spokeswoman Alina Labrada, said Thursday, adding the process did not help those who consistently went hungry. \"They are being hurt instead of helped by this mechanism.\" The United States Agency for International Development said Thursday that its experts carry out detailed assessments to try to ensure that commodities do not disrupt local production. \"The choice we are facing is not between having the 280 million that goes into development programs in cash or food,\" said Jim Kunder, USAID's acting deputy adminstrator. \"The choice is: we have 280 million in food, can we translate it into cash?\"\n",

Frist, a Tennessee Republican who did not seek re-election to the Senate last year, would replace former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. The nomination to the three-year term on the board of the Millennium Challenge Corp. must be confirmed by the Senate. \"I'm delighted at the opportunity to serve on a board that reflects the absolute necessity of having transparency and accountability tied to our developmental foreign aid,\" Frist told The Associated Press. Bush in 2002 proposed the creation of the Millennium Challenge account to distribute foreign aid to poor countries committed to tackling corruption and supporting human rights. Under the program, countries agree to complete certain tasks to get the money. The program was formally launched in 2004, but Congress funded it at only about half the $9 billion (euro6.48 billion) Bush originally envisioned for its first three years.

EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel said the funding for a new global climate change alliance was \"only a startup\" and he wanted EU nations to add their own money to the pot -- warning that a lot more was needed to reduce poverty and save lives. \"Natural disasters are increasing,\" he said, citing euro24.5 million (US$34 million) in EU funds already given in the last two months to victims of hurricanes, floods and drought in Colombia, Caribbean, Kenya, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, North Korea, the Sudan as well as for the Peru earthquake. The funds aim to help people prepare better for natural disasters by swapping know-how. It will pay for measures such as flood defences, reducing emissions from deforestation, helping poor countries set up programs that could cash in on rich nations' carbon offsets and making climate change a part of other development aid efforts. \"Obviously top priority will go to the least developed countries ...and these small island states but no-one is ruled out,\" Michel said.\n",

The bank said that the country suffered from a broad range of \"declared and undeclared\" embargoes that hit Zimbabwe's weakest the hardest. The drying up of development project finance and hard currency loans from international institutions has had \"far reaching effects on the majority of the people since 2000,\" the report said. \"Far from the claim that sanctions are ... targeted on a few individuals, the reality on the ground is the tight grip of sanctions is being felt throughout the economy,\" it said. Western officials argue loan support, development aid and investment disappeared not because of sanctions but because of fears about levels of risk -- worsened by corruption, mismanagement and threats of property seizures -- and concern over Zimbabwe's human rights record.\n",

      "Central African Republic president defends efforts to improve human rights at donor aid talks. Central African Republic's president defended his country's efforts to improve human rights at international donor talks Friday meant to bolster much needed economic and political reforms in his impoverished nation. Francois Bozize presented a new development strategy to EU and U.N. officials in a bid to collect some euro1.14 billion (US$1.6 billion) in aid to help pay for 300 projects included in the plan, such as building up his nation's underfunded military, to constructing much needed roads, bridges and schools. Bozize acknowledged that many parts of his country remain under the control of various rebel groups and vulnerable to neighboring conflicts in Darfur and Chad, which he said were undermining efforts to fight poverty and bring stability. The president, who seized power in a 2003 coup and was elected in a disputed 2005 vote, criticized a report by U.S.-based Human Rights Watch last month that said government troops were responsible for various atrocities at home against their own citizens. The report said an elite unit of Bozize's presidential guard had been behind the burning of villages, killings of 30 civilians, including the beheading of a teacher in the north of the country, last year.\n",

      "Mexico scrambles to evacuate flooded Gulf coast area as rains return. Rescue workers in helicopters and small boats scrambled to evacuate thousands of people as rains returned Saturday to Mexico's flooded Gulf coast region. Many victims have spent the better part of a week trapped by the rising waters, and authorities warned of a possible health crisis and scattered reports of looting. President Felipe Calderon, who surveyed the disaster zone from the air on Friday, called the flooding one of Mexico's worst recent natural disasters. Emergency shelters already held 69,000 flood victims, but tens of thousands more were leaving the state entirely, as food, water and power became increasingly scarce. \"We are not going to fight over food. Everybody here has suffered the same,\" said Maria del Carmen Arias, 48, as her granddaughter slept in her lap at an improvised shelter at a church in Villahermosa, the badly flooded capital of Tabasco state. Arias said her family may leave the city as well, to stay at a relative's farm. Tons of supplies and medical aid streamed into the region aboard planes and trucks, but little food and water was available at stores in Villahermosa, where intermittent rains fell early Saturday.\n",

Aid workers struggled Friday to help hundreds of thousands of survivors of a cyclone that slammed into the coast with 150-mph (240-kph) winds, killing a reported 1,100 people, savaging waterfront towns and villages and plunging much of the country into darkness, a Bangladeshi news agency said Friday. Rescuers struggled through washed-out roads and areas blocked by wind-blown debris to get water and emergency food supplies to people stranded by floodwaters from Tropical Cyclone Sidr, witnesses said. The damage to livelihood, housing and crops from Sidr will be \"extremely severe,\" said John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. Speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York, Holmes said the world body was making millions of dollars in aid available to Bangladesh. The winds wreaked havoc on the country's electricity and telephone lines, affecting even areas that were spared a direct hit by the storm, and leaving the full extent of the death and destruction unclear. By late Friday night, about 24 hours after the cyclone made landfall, officials were still struggling to get reports in from many of the worst-hit districts. Dhaka, the capital city of this poor, desperately crowded nation of 150 million people, remained without power Friday night.

Floods, droughts and other climate disasters will rob millions of children of the decent meals and schools they need unless rich nations provide $86 billion (euro57.9 billion) by 2015 to help the poor adapt to global warming, an expert panel warned Tuesday. The U.S. government needs to cover $40 billion (euro26.95 billion) of that spending, which will \"strengthen the capacity of vulnerable people\" to cope with climate-related risks, says the report commissioned by the U.N.

It adds a dire economic perspective to previous U.N. scientific findings that carbon and other heat-trapping \"greenhouse gas\" emissions must stabilize by 2015 and then decline. Without the money, the panel found, a warmer world \"could stall and then reverse human development\" in the countries where 2.6 billion people live on US$2 (euro1.35) a day or less. In Washington, the $40 billion (euro26.9 billion) recommendation equals the amount of U.S. spending for the Iraq war every four months and could be money well spent preparing for climate change, a senior Democratic congressional aide in the U.S. Congress told The Associated Press.\n",

The United Nations' human rights committee has been critical of the Bush administration's efforts to help people displaced by Katrina in August 2005, in particular the poor without the means to rebuild on their own.

Changes in climate brought by global warming could cause major crop losses in many of the world's poorest regions within the next two decades, environmental specialists reported Thursday. The findings foresee alarming consequences for many of the 1 billion poor people who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, largely because agriculture is the human activity that is most vulnerable to changes in climate. The worst affected areas were projected to be southern Africa and South Asia, already home to huge numbers of hungry people. Researcher David Lobell, lead author of the study published in the journal Science, said understanding where and when climate threats will have the greatest effect is crucial to fighting hunger and poverty in coming decades. Once that is done, Lobell said, governments, international organizations and others will have to try to find ways to adapt the hardscrabble agriculture of the hard-hit areas to compensate for the new conditions.\n",

Midway to the deadline, progress is too slow to succeed in some key areas -- notably efforts to provide food, shelter and improved care for mothers and children in sub-Saharan Africa -- according to internal U.N. documents and interviews with senior diplomats and U.N. and U.S. officials. Top diplomats and other officials say the world's nations may have set overly ambitious goals in September 2000, reflecting the still-booming world economy. The goals also were set at a time when the implications of climate change -- and its many effects -- were not as widely accepted. Virtually all the world's nations signed off on the sweeping package of eight U.N. \"millennium development goals\" in September 2000.

The worker bonuses and other concessions promised to workers by the prime minister show the government's worry that economic angst could boil over -- a risk the U.N. warns could hit many poor countries as world inflation spirals. The soft approach is in stark contrast to the rough treatment that the quarter-century-old regime of President Hosni Mubarak metes out to its political opponents, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's most powerful opposition movement. Hundreds of Brotherhood members have been arrested in recent months, and the group was all but completely barred from running in elections held across the country Tuesday for local councils. The worldwide rise in prices has struck particularly hard in Egypt, a top U.S. ally where 40 percent of the population lives near the poverty line of US$2 (euro1.27) a day.

Rising food prices, stoked by increased fuel costs, have led to the world's first major food crisis since World War II and sparked protests across the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. \"Tackling hunger is a moral challenge to each of us and it is also a threat to the political and economic stability of nations,\" Brown said, in a statement released Tuesday ahead of the meeting in London. Unrest provoked by the food crisis has led to deaths in Cameroon and Haiti, and cost Haitian Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis his job.

      "World Food Program appeals for hundreds of millionsto cope with the \" new face of hunger \". The World Food Program is appealing for hundreds of millions of dollars to cope with the \"new face of hunger\" caused by the global food crisis which has sparked protests and food riots in more than 34 countries. The program's executive director, Josette Sheeran, said Thursday the U.N. agency still needs about US$280 million urgently just to pay for the 40 percent increase in the cost of food for its regular budget. That budget will provide food for refugees and internally displaced people in places like Darfur, victims of natural disasters and newly hungry people in Afghanistan and elsewhere. At the same time, Sheeran said, WFP is bracing for new requests for food aid from countries that are unable to deal with the sharp rise in food prices, like Haiti, that will require millions of dollars in additional funding.\n",

The World Food Program appealed for hundreds of millions of dollars (euros) to cope with rising food prices that have sparked protests and food riots in 34 countries and led to bans on food exports in about 40 nations. Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, said the U.N. agency is facing a 40 percent increase in the cost of food and requests for food aid from countries unable to cope with the rising prices. It expects additional requests from nations like Haiti whose citizens are becoming part of \"the new face of hunger,\" she told a video news conference from Rome with U.N. correspondents in New York on Thursday. WFP usually helps between 80 and 90 million people a year and it is entirely funded by voluntary contributions. It traditionally helps refugees and internally displaced people in places like Darfur, and victims of natural disasters. Sheeran said WFP's initial budget of US$3.1 billion needed to be increased by an additional US$755 million just to cope with the 40 percent increase in food prices. It also needs an extra US$418 million for new requests including $77 million (euro48.83 million) to help feed \"2.5 million newly urgently hungry people\" in Afghanistan, and new Iraqi refugees in Syria and elsewhere, she said.\n",

Military-ruled Myanmar, among the globe's poorest and most authoritarian nations, is reeling from a natural disaster of such magnitude that both the people's suffering and political aftershocks are certain to persist long after the last emergency aid has been doled out. As bloated bodies are counted and survivors face disease and hunger in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, dramatic scenarios are foreseen in a country that has changed little since an army coup 46 years ago. These range from a revolt led by disenchanted army officers to the specter of the entrenched, xenophobic junta allowing thousands more to perish rather than risk its grip on power by opening gates to the outside world. \"If a split in the Burmese military between reformist and hard-line elements doesn't occur now, it will never occur,\" said Donald M. Seekins, a Myanmar expert at Okinawa's Meio University. In continuing to march to their own, longtime tune even in the face of such a disaster, the generals who rule the country also known as Burma are comparable to Zimbabwe and North Korea, which insist on controlling the distribution of the relief goods while keeping foreign aid personnel on their soil to a minimum.\n",

The rapid mobilization reflected the priority China's leadership places on delivering efficient disaster relief while showing the world it stands ready for anything that may come during the Olympic Games in three months. Monday's 7.9-magnitude temblor -- the deadliest to hit in three decades -- has left more than 12,000 people dead, with at least another 18,000 missing across urban areas and mountain villages in central China. Beijing's leaders were quick to signal a message of concern and action, as President Hu Jintao called for an \"all-out\" effort to aid survivors. Premier Wen Jiabao flew to the stricken province of Sichuan just hours after the quake to oversee relief efforts. Rescue workers mounted a huge search effort Tuesday, using cranes and manpower to look for survivors under massive blocks of concrete and steel.

He spoke on condition of anonymity citing office policy. North Korea has relied on foreign assistance to feed its 23 million people since the 1990s, when natural disasters and mismanagement devastated the country's economy. As many as 2 million people are believed to have died from famine at the time. The North's current food situation has worsened because of devastating floods last year.

But he said the neutral ICRC would have to shoulder a big responsibility \"when that violence reaches the level of an armed conflict,\" noting that the body already was delivering food to isolated or dangerous places where the U.N.'s World Food Program cannot operate. \"You can imagine when you have countries where you have already an armed conflict, where you have already a high level of violence and you have at the same time a lot of poor and extremely vulnerable people,\" Kellenberger said.\n",

World food prices are set to fall from current peaks in the coming years but will remain \"substantially above\" average levels from the past decade, a report said Thursday. The world's poorest nations are most vulnerable -- particularly the urban poor in food-importing countries -- and will require increased humanitarian aid to stave off hunger and undernourishment, a joint agricultural outlook by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said. High oil prices, changing diets, urbanization, expanding populations, flawed trade policies, extreme weather, growth in biofuel production and speculation have sent food prices soaring worldwide, trigging protests from Africa to Asia and raising fears that millions more will suffer malnutrition. \"There is a real need to foster growth and development in poor countries and to assist in developing their agricultural supply base,\" the report said. The report is based on a forecast of the cereals, oilseeds, sugar, meats, milk and dairy products markets for the period 2008 to 2017. It reflects agriculture and trade policies in place in early 2008 and includes an assessment of the biofuels markets for bioethanol and biodiesel.\n",

At least 2 million people in Zimbabwe face greater risk of starvation, homelessness and disease because the government ordered aid groups to halt operations there, according to the U.N.'s top humanitarian official. \"This is a deplorable decision,\" said John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said Friday. \"If voluntary organizations and NGOs are not able to work, humanitarian aid for at least 2 million of the most poor and vulnerable of Zimbabwe's people, particularly children, will be severely restricted, although we will do our best to make up for this,\" Holmes said. \"Clearly, that's a very large number.\" Much of the U.N.'s aid in Zimbabwe is funneled through non-governmental organizations. Holmes' comments came after the United States and Britain warned Friday that Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime is using food and the threat of hunger as a weapon to cling to power ahead of the June 27 runoff election.\n",

      "US report says global warming could have indirect but wide-ranging national security impact. Global warming is likely to increase illegal immigration, create humanitarian disasters and destabilize precarious governments and could add to terrorism, all of which could threaten U.S. national security, according to an assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies. \"Logic suggests the conditions exacerbated (by climate change) would increase the pool of potential recruits for terrorism,\" said Tom Fingar, deputy director of national intelligence for analysis, who testified before a joint House committee hearing Wednesday. Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central and Southeast Asia are most vulnerable to warming-related drought, flooding, extreme weather and hunger. The intelligence assessment warns of a global spillover of those troubles: increased migration and water-related disputes, he said in prepared remarks. Climate change alone would not topple governments, but it could worsen problems like poverty, disease, migration, and hunger that could destabilize already vulnerable areas, Fingar told the committee. But he warned that efforts to reduce global warming by changing energy policies \"may affect U.S. national security interests even more than the physical impacts of climate change itself,\" he stated.\n",

The United Nations and Afghanistan's government launched a US$400 million food aid appeal Wednesday to help feed 4.5 million vulnerable Afghans. The worldwide rise in food prices coupled with a poor harvest and drought in the country is affecting 450,000 Afghan households, a U.N. said in a statement. The funds would also be used to provide safe drinking water, promote good hygiene in drought-affected communities and improve disease control where it is weak, the statement said. Last year Afghanistan was able to produce over 90 percent of its own food. The harvest for this year is forecast to be around only two-thirds of domestic need. Around two million tons of grain will have to be imported. Afghanistan is reliant on aid and imports to help fill its food deficit, so it is particularly vulnerable to increased international prices driven by growing demand from China and India and the use of grain to make bio-fuel.\n",

Every inch of Rivilade Filsame's body hurt, from his swollen, empty stomach to his dried-out, wrinkled skin. The 18-month-old had been crying for so long in the hospital malnutrition ward that his mother no longer tried to console him. After soaring food prices led to deadly riots in April, the U.S. and the U.N. promised millions of dollars in aid to poor families like Rivilade's, as well as help for farmers to break Haiti's dependence on imported food. But three months later, The Associated Press has learned that only a fraction of a key U.S. food pledge -- less than 2 percent as of early July -- has been distributed. Even those who oversee the food aid programs say they are stopgap measures. Programs to create jobs and to help Haitian farmers increase production are more critical to ending the country's chronic hunger once and for all. But right now, aid workers say, the poorest families need immediate help, and little of the emergency food promised has reached them. Most of what has reached Haiti is stuck in port. Nearly all the rest is still inside warehouses -- victim of high fuel prices, bad roads and a weak national government.\n",

No matter how much she loved the river and sea that once provided her family's daily food, Tin Tin Latt now just wants to stay away from the water that widowed her, killed two of her children and destroyed the family's livelihood. Tin Tin Latt is among thousands of widows of fishermen in Myanmar's cyclone-devastated Irrawaddy delta who have been forced to become breadwinners without land to farm or the means to earn money from the sea. Cyclone Nargis, which struck in early May, killed 84,500 people and left 54,000 missing, according to the ruling junta, in the worst natural disaster in Myanmar's modern history and the world's fifth deadliest in the past 40 years. Of the dead, 27,000 were fishermen, the regime says, although aid workers believe the actual number is far higher. The U.N. food agency says more than 100,000 fishermen have been affected and some 50,000 acres of fish ponds destroyed. The storm also destroyed boats, nets, jetties and processing plants, crippling a top export revenue earner in one of the world's poorest nations. Last year, Myanmar exported some 350,000 tons (317,000 metric tons) of seafood to European and Asian countries, much of it from the vast delta with its long coastline and spider web of rivers.\n",

The U.N. food aid agency found some rural Zimbabweans subsisting on wild fruits when it was able to reach the countryside after months of being blocked by the government, the agency said Thursday as it appealed for more donations to fight hunger there. Zimbabwe's governing party accused independent groups of supporting opposition activists and barred them from distributing aid for three months. The ban was lifted in late August, but the groups, which had denied the accusations of political bias, were not able to resume work immediately for logistical reasons. World Food Program spokesman Richard Lee accompanied workers handing out dried corn, vegetable oil and other aid in central Zimbabwe over the weekend in one of the first mass distributions since the ban was lifted. Zimbabwe's economic collapse, with inflation of at least 231 million percent a year, has put seeds, fertilizer and farming equipment out of the reach of many. AIDS has devastated the farming work force. Weather also has played a role, with too much rain in some areas and too little in others last year. The combination of factors and years of food scarcity have put Zimbabwe in a category all its own in a region where other countries are poor and others have been buffeted by AIDS and bad weather.\n",

The gap between rich and poor is getting bigger in the world's richest countries -- and particularly the United States -- as top earners' incomes soar while others' stagnate, according to a 30-nation report released Tuesday. In a 20-year study of its member countries, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said wealthy households are not only widening the gap with the poor, but in countries such as the U.S., Canada and Germany they are also leaving middle-income earners further behind, with potentially ominous consequences if the global financial crisis sparks a long recession. Inequality threatens the \"American Dream\" of social mobility -- children doing better than their parents, the poor improving their lot through hard work -- which is lower in the U.S. than countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Australia, the report found. The two decades covered in the study -- 1985-2005 -- saw the development of global trade and the Internet, and a period of overall strong economic growth. The countries covered are mostly developed nations, especially in Europe. The United States has the highest inequality and poverty in the OECD after Mexico and Turkey, and the gap has increased rapidly since 2000, the report said.

Famine is believed to have killed 2 million people. The country's food shortage has worsened this year following devastating floods in 2007. The WFP also said the food shortages have especially affected urban households in areas with low industrial activity due to higher food prices, reductions in public food rations and lower employment. The food shortage warning comes as the North has ratcheted up its hostile rhetoric against South Korea and its president amid fraying ties.\n",

      "Film on plight of world ' s poorest opens in Rome. The plight of the world's poorest was highlighted Thursday as \"8\" (Huit), a collection of short movies inspired by the U.N.'s Millennium Goals, premiered at the Rome Film Festival. The movie, touching on themes such as the fight against poverty and hunger, child mortality, the environment and education, is made of eight segments by eight directors, including Jane Campion and Wim Wenders, who were in Rome to present the project. \"This movie is directed to people, audiences will see it, some of them will engage themselves,\" Wenders told reporters after a press screening of the movie. \"A lot of people who will see the film will understand the urgency of the Millennium Goals but the solution is only with governments, because they have to act as they promised.\" Wenders' segment on the need for partnership for development includes footage of anti-G-8 protesters and explores the coverage decisions of a TV channel reporting on efforts to reach the U.N. Goals. Other stories -- filmed by directors Mira Nair, Abderrahmane Sissako, Gus Van Sant, Gaspar Noe, Jan Kounen and Gael Garcia Bernal -- include the life of an African man who has AIDS, the struggle of a pregnant woman in the Amazon rain forest who cannot afford to travel to a hospital and a devastating drought in Australia.\n",

      "Cambodian woman activist given $1.3 million award. A Cambodian woman activist who has spearheaded her country's battle against sex traffickers is the first recipient of an award from a recently established human rights foundation, the German Embassy announced Friday. The 1 million euro ($1.269 million) award to Somaly Mam from the Munich-based Roland Berger Foundation rivals in amount the Nobel Peace Prize, which includes a grant of 10 million Swedish kroner ($1.268 million). The Roland Berger Human Dignity Award was given to Somaly Mam -- who herself is a former sex trade victim -- \"in recognition of her fight for a world without slavery,\" the German Embassy said in a statement. Somaly Mam was sold into prostitution as a child and later escaped with the help of foreigners and aid workers. She has written about her experience in a recently published book, \"The Road of Lost Innocence.\" She currently heads a group named AFESIP -- from the French acronym for Acting for Women in Distressing Situations -- which has helped build safe houses that provide refuge, care and schooling for girls rescued from slavery.\n",

      "World Bank praises Bangladesh poverty reduction. Natural disasters and a spike in food prices have been setbacks for impoverished Bangladesh's \"encouraging\" progress toward halving poverty by 2015, the World Bank said. Annual economic growth running at 6 percent for the past few years has reduced the percentage of people living on $1 a day to 40 percent from 49 percent in 2000 but gains have recently faltered, the Washington-based lender said in a report released Sunday. \"Recent shocks to the Bangladeshi economy in the form of natural disasters and rising food prices have partially dampened the rapid progress in reducing poverty,\" the report said. A severe cyclone last year killed more than 3,000 people and caused massive damage to crops and infrastructure just as the country was recovering from monsoon floods. Floods and cyclones are common to this low-lying delta nation. The report also said the more than 20 percent rise in food prices eroded some of the gains from economic growth and slowed the pace of poverty reduction.\n",

      "Somali prime minister seeks international help. Somalia is at a dangerous crossroads after nearly two decades of lawlessness, and urgently needs international help to stem an Islamic insurgency and rampant piracy off the coast, the prime minister said Tuesday. Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein spoke days after Ethiopia announced it would withdraw its troops from the country by the end of this month. The pullout will leave the Somali government vulnerable to Islamic insurgents who already control towns just a few miles (kilometers) from the capital, Mogadishu, and move freely inside the city. \"The international community should play their role now, and not tomorrow, to avoid any power vacuum,\" Hussein told The Associated Press in an interview from the patio of a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya. Civilians have taken the brunt of the violence surrounding the insurgency, with thousands killed or maimed by mortar shells, machine-gun crossfire and grenades. The United Nations says there are around 300,000 acutely malnourished children in Somalia, but attacks and kidnappings of aid workers and foreigners have shut down many aid projects. Somalia has urged the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force, which the U.N. Security Council said was possible if the country can improve its security situation.\n",

The Inter-American Development Bank will double its aid to Haiti next year to help the impoverished nation upgrade its crumbling infrastructure and broaden social programs, the bank's chief announced Sunday. IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno, in comments at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince, said the bank will double its grants to Haiti to US$100 million for 2009 to help the country's government with a raft of vital investments. \"Haiti is the most fragile of our member countries. No other nation in Latin America and the Caribbean is as vulnerable to economic shocks and natural disasters,\" Moreno said. \"It requires extraordinary assistance from the international community.\" IDB's announcement comes a few months after some 800 people were confirmed dead after four devastating storms hit Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Rural families already struggling with soaring food prices lost their safety nets when fields were destroyed and livestock wiped out by the storms, which caused $1 billion worth of damage in August and September.\n",

      "Report: China offers aid to impoverished NKorea. North Korea's state media said Wednesday that China has offered Pyongyang aid, a deal that was likely reached at a recent meeting between reclusive leader Kim Jong Il and a senior Chinese official. The Korean Central News Agency said in a brief dispatch that the aid will be \"an encouragement\" to North Koreans in their efforts to build \"a great, prosperous, powerful nation.\" It did not say what kind or how much aid China had offered. The impoverished communist country has resorted to outside handouts to help feed its 23 million people since its centrally controlled economy collapsed in the mid-1990s due to natural disasters and mismanagement. Wednesday's report came after senior Chinese Communist Party official Wang Jiarui visited Pyongyang last month and met Kim. Wang was the first foreign dignitary known to have seen the North Korean leader since he reportedly suffered a stroke in August. China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War and remains Pyongyang's only major ally and a key donor of food and energy. Beijing has traditionally provided aid to North Korea after dispatching senior officials to Pyongyang.\n",

The year-old U.S. offshoot of the Grameen Bank that the former economics professor founded in Bangladesh three decades ago also is looking to expand into New Jersey, Nebraska, Louisiana and other U.S. states as economic turmoil closes employment doors on more people. \"It was not in our agenda to be in a crisis, but the crisis is here,\" Yunus said Thursday with several members of North Carolina's banking establishment flanking him. The micro-lending model means \"you create your own jobs instead of waiting for other people to hire you.\" North Carolina lenders see Grameen America as an economic development organization reaching out to open the way for people with entrepreneurial skills or a business idea but who are too poor even to set up a bank account.\n",

And more than four decades passed before the Empire State Building appeared on the Manhattan skyline seen from the windows of the Brooklyn convent. Since 1862, the fortress-like complex has sheltered, educated and nurtured people in need, from Irish orphans to developmentally disabled adults and poor Hispanic children. But suddenly, some months ago, the convent's elderly residents faced shattering news: They learned they'd be forced to leave the \"mother house\" of the Sisters of Mercy in Brooklyn, a Roman Catholic order whose aim is \"to help people to overcome the obstacles that keep them from living full and dignified lives,\" according to their mission statement. The reason for the convent closure in mid-February: money. Engineers said it would cost more than $20 million to fix structural and safety problems discovered in the building in the Fort Greene neighborhood. Preservationists fear that the property -- a collection of buildings that covers almost a city block -- could be targeted by developers and demolished, like other religious institutions across the country that have vanished for lack of money or members.\n",

The judge denounced the lawyers who hatched the scheme and said there was a group of corrupt Nicaraguan judges \"devouring bribes\" to make judgments and aid the scheme. The lawsuits ended up in the California court seeking enforcement of extravagant damages determined by Nicaraguan judges.\n",

      "World Bank: Globe bracing for more poverty. The global economic crisis has stymied the international community's effort to halve extreme poverty by 2015 and meet other goals to reduce hunger, fight disease and get young children to school, the World Bank warned on Friday. A report released in conjunction with this week's meeting of the bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington said the financial meltdown is impeding efforts to achieve most of the eight U.N. millennium development goals. Although it still may be possible to reach the first goal -- halving extreme poverty by 2015 from its 1990 level -- it will be an uphill battle, according to \"The Global Monitoring Report 2009: A Development Emergency.\" \"With simultaneous recessions striking all major regions, the likelihood of painfully slow recoveries in many countries is very real, making the fight against poverty more challenging and more urgent,\" said John Lipsky, deputy managing director of the IMF. New estimates show that more than half of all developing countries could experience a rise in the number of extremely poor people this year. The report said it's estimated that 55 million to 90 million more people will be trapped in extreme poverty this year due to the worldwide recession. The number of chronically hungry people is expected to climb to more than 1 billion this year, reversing gains made in fighting malnutrition and making it even more urgent to invest in agriculture. \"Worldwide, we have an enormous loss of wealth and financial stability,\" said Justin Yifu Lin, an economist at the World Bank. \"Millions more people will lose their jobs in 2009, and urgent funding must be provided for social safety nets, infrastructure and small businesses in poor countries, for a sustainable recovery.\"\n",

      "LA judge rules fraud in lawsuits against Dole. In a ruling with ramifications for other countries, a California judge dismissed two lawsuits by purported Nicaraguan banana plantation workers against U.S. food giant Dole, finding that greedy lawyers and corrupt judges committed fraud and extortion in a blatant scheme to win billions of dollars in damages. \"This is a very sad day for me to be presiding over such a horrific situation,\" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Victoria Chaney said late Thursday. The decision came after three days of testimony that detailed a scheme to recruit men who would claim they were rendered sterile by exposure to a pesticide in the 1970s. In most cases, the men had not worked at plantations and were not sterile. Witnesses and investigators who exposed the fraud told of fearing for their lives. The judge denounced the lawyers who hatched the scheme and said there was a group of corrupt Nicaraguan judges \"devouring bribes\" to make judgments and aid the plot. Chaney had heard closed-door testimony about a Nicaraguan judge who presided over a meeting of the conspirators and advised them on how to fake lab tests to feign sterility and win lawsuits.\n",

Hundreds of destitute illegal immigrants have taken over an old courthouse steps away from central Athens' tourist hotels, living for months amid piles of fetid rubbish and human waste in an eight-story building without electricity, running water or sanitation. Aid workers warned on Saturday that the situation has been allowed to spiral out of control and turn into a public health hazard, while police were bracing for pro- and anti-immigrant demonstrations in nearby Omonoia Square later in the day. One was called by a far-right group to demand immigrants be thrown out of Greece, and another by human rights and left-wing groups in support of immigrant rights. Similar demonstrations last year led to clashes between rival protesters that left three people hurt. Greece is on one of the main smuggling routes for immigrants heading to Europe, with tens of thousands sneaking into the country each year. Authorities say the country's location at Europe's eastern frontier means Greece needs assistance to cope with the influx. Thousands of the new arrivals head to the cities in search of work. But with the global financial crisis beginning to bite in Greece, both immigrants and aid groups say jobs are becoming scarcer, leaving many unable to pay for even basic necessities. Although Greece has not yet faced major layoffs, the economy is slowing and unemployment jumped to 9.4 percent in January.\n",

      "Food summit turns down UN funding appeal. Pope Benedict XVI decried the rise in hunger in what he called a world often ruled by profit in an address to a food summit Monday shortly after it rebuffed a U.N. appeal to commit billions of dollars annually to helping farmers in poor countries. Some 60 heads of state and dozens of ministers from other nations rejected the U.N.'s call to commit to $44 billion annually for a new strategy focusing on agricultural development in poor nations as a way to enable farmers to produce enough food for their own countries. \"Hunger is the most cruel and concrete sign of poverty,\" said Benedict. \"Opulence and waste are no longer acceptable when the tragedy of hunger is assuming ever greater proportions.\" It was unclear if Benedict was referring directly to the failure to secure money pledges as sought by the U.N. food agencies, but Vatican Radio on Monday called the lack of a firm money commitment \"disturbing.\" U.N. officials say roughly 1 billion people -- one of every six people on the planet -- don't get enough to eat.\n",

A veteran dissident was sentenced to three years in prison after casting a spotlight on poorly built schools that collapsed and killed thousands of children during China's massive earthquake last year -- an apparent government attempt to squelch such information. Huang Qi, founder of a human rights Web site, had been charged with illegally possessing state secrets, his wife Zeng Li said Monday by telephone. His detention in June 2008 came after several posts on his blog that criticized the government's response to the massive earthquake that struck Sichuan province a month earlier and killed about 90,000 people. Huang had alleged that state-controlled media provided skewed reports on relief efforts and accused the government of obstructing the work of non-governmental organizations responding to the disaster, according to reports at the time by Paris-based monitoring group Reporters Without Borders. \"The government is using its propaganda to portray itself as a savior to little avail,\" the group quoted him as saying in one Web posting. Huang had also spoken to foreign media outlets about parents' accusations that their children had been crushed in badly built schools.

      "ADB: Philippine poverty up despite economic growth. Moderate economic growth in the Philippines in recent years did not translate to poverty reduction, which has been slower compared to the country's neighbors, said an Asian Development Bank report released Thursday. Household poverty rose by 2.5 percentage points to 26.9 percent from 2003 to 2006, and the number of poor people swelled by nearly 4 million people to 27.6 million despite an average domestic economic growth rate of 5.3 percent for the period, it said. The level of inequality among Filipinos -- who currently number around 90 million today -- has hardly changed for more than 20 years and remains high compared to other countries in Asia, limiting the beneficial impact of economic growth on poverty, said the study. The report also said the Philippine poverty reduction rate of 0.47 percent per year between 1990 to 2005 was slower than in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, adding that only in the Philippines has the overall number of poor people increased during that period. The Manila-based lender said to blame are low to moderate economic growth for the past 40 years, high population growth, weakness in job generation, failure to fully develop agriculture, recurrent conflicts and natural disasters.\n",

Endemic instability, murderous dictators, more than 30 coups and a seemingly endless series of hurricanes and other natural disasters have claimed countless souls over Haiti's tumultuous 206-year history, leaving it the Americas' poorest country and utterly dependent on foreign aid. Add to that Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, the strongest to hit what is now Haiti since 1770. Initial reports on its destruction are frightening. The quake occurred along a fault line believed responsible for seven large quakes between 1618 and 1860, said Harley Benz of the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. According to historical records, the 1860 quake struck Port-au-Prince and may have produced a tsunami. The largest recorded earthquake in modern times on the island of Hispaniola was an 8.1-magnitude temblor that produced a tsunami and killed 1,790 people in 1946. Centered in the Dominican Republic, it extended into Haiti, according to the USGS.\n",

The separate trips -- the two even flew on separate flights -- showed deep divisions in Zimbabwe's power-sharing coalition government, forged last year as a compromise after disputed national elections in 2008. The leaders' refusal to collaborate also bodes poorly for the success of the struggling coalition. Mugabe flew Monday to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's economic hub, on Zimbabwe's national airline for a summit of African liberation leaders who had fought for independence from colonial-era rule. The meeting aimed to find ways to combat the resurgence of Western imperialist threats to developing nations, as Zimbabwe's state radio, which is controlled by Mugabe's party, reported Tuesday. Tsvangirai flew separately for a meeting of the World Economic Forum on Africa, a Western-backed conference on investment and development aid, his office said.\n",

      "UN releases $42 million for humanitarian crises. The U.N. humanitarian chief has released $42 million to help people suffering from hunger, disease and conflict in nine countries from Congo and Yemen to North Korea and Nepal. John Holmes said Friday the United Nations has received insufficient funds from donors to meet humanitarian needs in the nine countries. The money, from an emergency fund to help the United Nations respond quickly to humanitarian emergencies, will be given to U.N. humanitarian agencies and the International Organization for Migration. Through them, funds will go to humanitarian and other nongovernmental organizations to cover funding gaps. According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, humanitarian actors in Chad and Congo will receive $8 million apiece, agencies in Yemen will receive $7 million, the humanitarian team in North Korea will get $5 million, humanitarian agencies in the Central African Republic, Djibouti, Eritrea and the Republic of Congo will each receive $3 million, and the U.N. team in Nepal will get $2 million. The General Assembly revamped the Central Emergency Response Fund in December 2005 after world leaders decided to make up to $500 million available so the U.N. could act speedily to help people caught in conflicts, natural disasters and other emergencies instead of waiting for donors to respond to appeals for aid.\n",

Niger is now facing the worst hunger crisis in its history, with almost half the country's population in desperate need of food and up to one in six children suffering from acute malnutrition, aid officials say. Malek Triki, West Africa spokesman for the United Nations' World Food Programme, said villagers in Niger are describing the situation as worse than in 2005, when aid organizations treated tens of thousands of children for malnutrition, and worse even than 1973, when thousands died. \"What they are saying is that this is the worst crisis in living memory,\" Triki said. National surveys conducted in May and June in the drought-stricken country on the southern fringe of the Sahara desert indicate that 16.7 percent of children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourished. That is well above the 15 percent threshold used by the U.N. to declare an emergency, according to the WFP. The WFP estimates that 7.3 million people -- almost half the country's population -- are in desperate need of food. In rural areas like Diffa, Triki says he spoke to numerous people who eat at most once a day.\n",

Aid workers say millions are at risk from hunger and waterborne diseases. Pakistani officials say the world has given or pledged more than $800 million of aid to the country since the flooding began in late July. But U.N. officials have criticized the slow response by some countries compared with other recent disasters. Cocking said the sluggish reaction was the result of several factors, including the slow-moving nature of the catastrophe compared to the Haitian earthquake in January or the 2004 Asian tsunami.\n",

In its first-ever report to the U.N.

Despite success in reforming such inequities as slavery and the denial of women's right to vote, the department said, considerable progress is still needed. \"Although we have made great strides, work remains to meet our goal of ensuring equality before the law for all,\" it said. The report noted that although the United States now has a black president and that women and Hispanics have won greater social and economic success, large segments of American society suffer from unfair policies and practices. High unemployment rates, hate crime, poverty, poor housing, lack of access to health care and discriminatory hiring practices are among challenges the report identified as affecting blacks, Latinos, Muslims, South Asians, American Indians and gays and lesbians in the United States.\n",

Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis were fleeing a southern district Friday after the bloated Indus River crushed a levee and flooded new areas, officials said. The U.N. said as many as 1 million people have been displaced in the south since midweek. The latest evacuations came after the Taliban issued a veiled threat against foreign aid workers helping out after the floods, a development that stands to complicate one of the largest relief efforts the world as ever seen. More than 8 million people are need in of emergency assistance across the country. In the southern city of Thatta, around 175,000 people -- around 70 percent of the city's population -- were believed to have packed up and left overnight, said Manzoor Sheikh, a senior government official. Authorities were trying to repair the broken levee and arranging transport for people trying to leave. U.N. spokesman Maurizio Giuliano said according to reports received by the world body, around 1 million people were displaced in Thatta and Qambar-Shadadkot districts since Wednesday. It is difficult to verify figures given by the authorities, however, partly because of poor or old census data and partly because of the difficulty of tracking migrations over such wide swaths of territory. Many of the areas are hard to reach because of the water, and people may have left their homes well before the evacuation orders.\n",

The U.N. children's agency says it has failed to reach millions of the world's neediest boys and girls in slums and remote countryside and is shifting to a strategy of getting critical health care services to the poorest of the poor. UNICEF's new approach would likely concentrate more on such initiatives as training rural health workers and building schools in remote areas, and less on building big modern hospitals and universities in cities, said Charlie MacCormack of the non-governmental Save the Children, which UNICEF consulted. It would cost less but also demand more planning and effort, he said. \"This is a refocus for UNICEF, ensuring that equity reaches into the most deprived areas,\" the agency's new executive director, veteran American diplomat Anthony Lake, told The Associated Press. The UNICEF report comes ahead of a global summit to study the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals -- objectives it set 10 years ago to halve rates of fatal disease, illiteracy, hunger and poverty by 2015 from what they were in 1990. It says the global mortality rate for children under 5 has been reduced from 90 to 65 per 1,000 live births since 1990. But it notes that mortality rates for infants and toddlers remain high in especially destitute regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where one of seven children died before their fifth birthday in 2008.\n",

With the majority of people on Earth now living in towns and cities, urban dwellers in middle and low income nations face rising threats from natural disasters, violence and health hazards, a Red Cross report said Tuesday. Risks are exacerbated by rapid urbanization, poor local governance, population growth and the worsening of natural disasters due to global warming, according to the World Disasters Report compiled by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"There are now 1 billion urban dwellers living in slums. If the conditions don't improve, more people will be affected in the case of major disasters like the Haiti earthquake,\" Alistair Henley, director of IFRC's Asia Pacific region, said at a news conference Tuesday. This year's report shifted its focus to hazards in cities in part because the development of disaster aid to urban dwellers has not kept up with the rapid pace of urbanization. The number of urban dwellers reached 3.5 billion this year, compared with 3.4 billion rural residents, the report said. Of all the disasters, seismic activity killed the most people -- an average of 50,184 people per year from 2000 to 2008, the report said. In 2009, natural disasters killed 10,551 people, a figure expected to be substantially higher this year with Haiti's earthquake alone killing as many as 300,000 people.\n",

Karzai has complained for years that many private guards commit human rights abuses, pay protection money to the Taliban and undercut the country's national security forces by offering higher wages and better living conditions. Nations providing aid to Afghanistan, however, question whether Afghan security forces -- poorly trained, rife with corruption and stretched thin fighting insurgents -- will be able to take on the work of the private guards. Contractors say they will not be able to find insurers if they are forced to give up private security.

      "Sports in 2010: Anything but trivial. In the greater scheme of things, sports shouldn't really matter. Not like famine, war, natural disasters or the multitude of other agonies of our human condition that will and should always be more important than the mere trivialities of which team won and by how much. In the same vein, no athlete, no matter how lionized, will or should ever be as important as a caring parent, an aid worker, a maternity nurse, a firefighter or the countless billions of unsung others who sustain life amid the chaos of life itself. No athlete can claim that their sporting achievements do that, which is why there will and should always be questions about whether it is right and proper that some of them are paid so obscenely well for doing what they do. And yet, in 2010, one of the few times I wept was at a sports event. Watching Canadian skater Joannie Rochette glide on Olympic ice days after the death of her mother was a truly humbling and uplifting lesson in courage. For the entirety of her bronze medal-winning free skate, I willed her to hold her emotions together, trying telepathically to say: \"You can do it. You can do it.\" This wasn't just out of sympathy for her, but for my own good, too. I needed Rochette to prove that there is a future after the death of a beloved parent, that life can go on. In the greater scheme things, those exquisitely anxious minutes of fretting about whether Rochette would crumble under the weight of her personal tragedy or, as she did, soar inspiringly above it should not have moved me as much as the birth, later in 2010, of my daughter. Yet, on both occasions, the tears tasted salty and curiously sweet. Sports shouldn't really matter. But they do. In 2010, rarely was I angrier than at a sports event. When England midfielder Frank Lampard's disallowed World Cup goal against Germany slammed against the crossbar and bounced a good foot over the line, I was furious that Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda failed to spot the blindingly obvious. I also was incensed at the technophobes at football's world governing body FIFA for resisting the electronic goal-line aids that could have spared Larrionda from looking like such a fool and ensured sporting justice.\n",

The global warming effects impacting all mankind are \"actually the effects of the human mind and its insatiable desires,\" a lecturer quoted Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, as saying Monday. In a special report presented at a monthly meeting of the Presidential Office, Ho Jih-sheng, spokesman for the foundation, said that, as Master Cheng Yen has often preached to her disciples, natural disasters  are rooted in man-made misfortunes, or the \"collective karma\" of mankind. He quoted the master as saying that the endless expansion of human desires has caused irreparable damage to the earth's resources by depleting the forests and emitting unsustainable amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. As the global population has been increasing, fresh water resources have been dwindling, and the area of livable land is expected to shrink as a result of the inevitable sea level rise due to global warming, Ho said. He also said that the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the rapid increase in the number of people living in poverty are the problems faced by all countries, and that the best solution to the problems lies in the \"expansion of human love.\"\n",

      "Commercial Times: Learn from U.S., Korean job creation initiatives. A proposal to add a clause to the disputed Industrial Innovation Bill that would give subsidies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for new hirings has been harshly criticized as a waste of taxpayers' money and an example of pork barrel politics. However, we believe the proposal is a necessary and legitimate step, similar to the job promotion measures adopted in the United States and South Korea recently to address their unemployment problems. The U.S. Senate passed a bill 10 days ago that would offer up to US$17.6 billion in social security tax exemption for American companies that hire people who have been out of work for more than 60 days. If people in this category are hired for more than one year, their employers will be given an additional US$1,000 in tax refund. The bill was initiated by the Democratic Party and secured the support of 11 opposition Republican senators. Meanwhile, South Korea is implementing a short-term employment promotion program that provides financial aid for SMEs that hire new workers, and is also planning to offer tax incentives to create more jobs. These initiatives are an indication that encouraging SMEs to hire more workers has gradually become an important policy of major countries around the world, amid rising unemployment associated with economic globalization. The main reasoning behind this development is that SMEs tend to be labor-intensive industries that have a strong potential to create jobs.\n",

      "Commercial Times: The poverty phenomenon. show that the number of households living below the poverty line rose to a record high of 108,000 in the second quarter of 2010. The ministry, however, said the rise does not necessarily represent an increase in poverty and should be interpreted as the result of expanded welfare benefits. This explanation leaves us totally speechless. In any case, the figure sends a very serious warning message. The ministry said the number increased because looser criteria have been adopted since early 2008 to define households that are qualified for public assistance. But this means that the same criteria have been adopted over the last three years, so how can the development be attributed to the relaxed criteria? Also, the MOI said the number was boosted by the increasing \"minimum cost of living\" in Taiwan. But the fact is that there has not been much change in the minimum cost of living over the past five years. Another reason cited by the ministry is the relaxation of the criteria regarding real estate ownership by low-income households in 2010. But even before that, the number of poor families had been rising -- by 40,000 within the last 10 years.\n",

      "Haitian survivors find refuge in Dominican Republic clinic. Although Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean, they are worlds apart. Haiti is often deemed as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with four of five people living below poverty line. The history of this small, heavily deforested Caribbean country has been plagued by violence, political upheaval,  and sporadic natural disasters. The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, has a relatively stable government and gorgeous sandy beaches to support a booming tourism industry that wheels in over US$2 billion each year. Expensive foreign car brands such as BMW and Mercedes Benz are common sights in the capital city of Santo Domingo. On the United Nations' Human Development Index, the Dominican Republic ranks 90th out of 182 countries while Haiti trails far behind at 149th. Immediately after a 7.3 magnitude temblor razed Haiti's capital of Port-au- Prince and killed at least 30,000 in 35 seconds in January 2010, Haiti's next door neighbor was the first to come knocking to offer goodwill and a helping hand.\n",

      " The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Baltimore Sun:. Step by step, President Clinton seems to be maneuvering himself into a position on Haiti where his only option may be military intervention. If that is the president's intention, it should be reversed forthwith. He must know that two-thirds of the American people oppose such a step; that with the first American casualties there will be a clamor for withdrawal of U.S. forces; that the last time Marines marched ashore in Haiti, in 1915, they were there 19 years, and after taking 126 combat and non-combat casualties left behind a trained -- and oppressive -- military. The ideal solution evidently sought by Clinton is sufficient international pressure to force the Haitian generals now in control into exile. There is a precedent: In 1986, the United States was able to send dictator Jean Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier packing. But there is another precedent: his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, successfully defied a U.S. show of force in 1963. By tightening the embargo on Haiti over last weekend, the world community decided in effect to increase the suffering of the Haitian people in order to liberate them. Food and medicine are the exception. But as jobs and private-sector imports of vital commodities disappear, aid organizations warn that hunger and death will increase. Some of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's more fervent supporters, both foreign and domestic, are willing to have the poorest people in the hemisphere's poorest country pay this price. The situation could force President Clinton's hand. Having taken on a certain responsibility for worsening the plight of the Haitian people and having drawn only defiance from Haiti's military government, he may find himself with little choice other than to order the Marines ashore. Some 650 aboard the USS Wasp are moving into position.\n",

      " and author of ``The Politics of Human Rights in Argentina'' \n",
      " (Stanford University Press.). Photos of newly enfranchised voters thronging polling places have become commonplace, from Russia to South Africa to El Salvador. But just as Americans begin to replace our image of the guerrilla with the citizen, nagging rips appear at the edges of the new picture. Why has democracy been reversed so quickly in Peru, Haiti and Serbia? Will political openings in Mexico and Indochina be endangered by social unrest? We Americans are notorious for our optimism, our pragmatism and our lack of historical consciousness. As the world democratizes, our optimistic assumption of a clean slate imperils the pragmatism necessary for making policy. Elections, we must remember, are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for democracy. If elections do not include major sectors of society (like peasants or former communists) or address key issues (like land reform or economic adjustment), new citizens will quickly become alienated and anti-system. Democracy must also include human rights, civilian control of the military and some measure of accountability for the new government once it has been elected. Citizenship implies empowerment, and elections are only the first step in that process. Rather than treat emerging democracies as infant republics, it is appropriate to see them as ``recovering authoritarians.'' Like recovering alcoholics, new democracies emerge damaged by a pattern of learned behavior to which they will always be especially susceptible. The bad news is that these countries' heritage will often war with their institutions. The good news is that this heritage is not cultural or eternal; learned behavior can be unlearned and the analysis of common patterns may help manage recovery. Thus, we should not be surprised at the problems shared by recovering authoritarians in all parts of the world: poverty, policing and polarization. Regardless of the previous level or path of economic development, recovering authoritarians experience poverty because unaccountable states have been inefficient and predatory economic managers. This is more than the conventional wisdom about distorting markets; market-oriented authoritarians have also dismantled infrastructure and looted the national patrimony.\n",

      "U.S. Aims to Head Off Threat of African Famine (Addis Ababa). A high-level U.S. aid delegation said Monday it aims to mobilize an urgent global response to food shortages in eastern Africa before they grow into full-blown famine. Ethiopia, which was devastated 10 years ago by starvation that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, this year risks becoming the center of a famine in which as many as 20 million people in nine countries could risk death, said J. Brian Atwood, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Famine threatens a swath of eastern Africa from Sudan to Tanzania, Atwood told a news conference. Relief workers in Ethiopia report hundreds of deaths since the current round of food shortages began here and scores of fresh graves in villages in the south of the country. Most of those in danger are victims of recurrent drought. Here, as in surrounding nations, the annual summer rains failed last year and food stocks are desperately low. But Atwood said about a third of those at risk this year are in danger because of wars-notably in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda. Atwood said the mission, which includes representatives of three main U.S. charities, is part of a new Clinton administration effort to shift U.S. policy from chronic emergency gear to crisis prevention. He said the administration aims to step up cooperation with what it has called ``a new breed'' of pragmatic African leaders in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda. President Clinton hopes to use the mission ``to raise consciousness of this issue at the highest possible levels'' and win more aid for eastern Africa from European governments and Japan, Atwood said. ``This is a desperate situation and we need to respond to it now to avoid what could become a major famine as soon as August if the rains fail'' again, he said. The U.S. team -- which includes the heads of CARE, Catholic Relief Services and the International Rescue Committee as well as the leading congressional campaigner on hunger issues, Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio --  will go to Europe this week to seek multilateral support for a program to head off another famine. Atwood said the more than $1.5 billion spent by the U.S. government in an effort to halt starvation and anarchy in Somalia had spotlighted in Washington the need to prevent --  rather than respond to -- humanitarian calamities in Africa. So, he said, has ``the holocaust'' in Rwanda, where the United Nations has estimated that 200,000 people have been killed in tribal massacres and battles.\n",

      "It's Dole vs. Clinton in the Health Care Reform Arena (Washn). The Clinton administration Thursday unveiled its strategy for the next crucial phase of the battle over health care reform -- attack Bob Dole. For months, White House officials have writhed in frustration as the ``Clinton plan'' became a label that a majority of Americans reject, even as polls show Americans continue to support key elements of what Clinton has proposed -- universal coverage, requirements that companies provide insurance to workers and cost controls. The problem, say White House officials, has been that their plan was being measured against each American's ideal of a perfect system. That problem was epitomized by the highly successful ``Harry and Louise'' television advertisements, which criticized Clinton's plan, but instead of offering a specific alternative proclaimed only that ``there must be a better way.'' But while administration officials do not believe they can win a battle of ``Bill Clinton vs. Harry and Louise,'' they think they may be able to win ``Bill Clinton vs. Bob Dole.'' In talks with reporters, White House aides and Clinton advisers set about joining that battle with gusto. ``The Dole-type proposals take care of the rich, because they can always buy (insurance), take care of the poor because they have governmental programs that can take care of them, and leave the middle class in great jeopardy,'' White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes told a group of reporters.\n",

      "Cholera Outbreak Adds Urgency to Rwandan Relief Efforts (Washn). Spurred by reports of a deadly cholera outbreak among Rwandan refugees, the Clinton administration, the United Nations and private relief agencies scrambled Thursday to speed the flow of aid into a region ill-equipped to receive it. U.S. officials and relief workers warned that the deaths may continue to accelerate because the relief effort is hampered by poor transportation, lack of clean water and sanitation facilities and the virulent nature of cholera. The Clinton administration committed another $41 million in supplies and transportation equipment Thursday, and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is scheduled to meet with other potential donor nations Friday to ask for $274 million more. The director of the U.S. Agency of International Development, who visited refugee encampments in Zaire this week, said after meeting President Clinton that the first priority of the relief mission now is to distribute medical supplies and clean water to help control cholera. AID Director J. Brian Atwood and Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen deLaski said it will take a vast and sustained international effort to cope with the tide of human misery in central Africa. As many as 1,000 U.S. troops may be sent to the area to aid the relief effort, officials said. They and U.N. officials rejected charges that the relief aid has been slow to develop, saying no one could have prepared for the sudden surge of Rwandan refugees, which overwhelmed the few relief agencies in the area.\n",

      "How Many People?. The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: With human population rising faster than ever before, there's a real risk that the United Nations' conference in Cairo could do more harm than good. The furious quarrels over abortion and contraception threaten damage to governments' attempts, often fragile and hesitant at best, to bring down their birth rates. The Vatican has launched a formidable attack on the United States's position in particular. The purpose of Vice President Al Gore's speech last week was to respond by broadening the debate and suggesting that the Clinton administration's purposes and its adversaries' -- including the Catholic Church's -- may have more in common than they think. First of all, he said, contrary to its opponents' charges, the United States is not trying to establish an international right to abortion or contraception. He wants the United States to use the Cairo conference to link together population control and development with great emphasis on improving the status of women. The differences over abortion are unlikely to be resolved, he acknowledged. But he went on to quote Pope John Paul II on the importance of regarding population policy as only a part of a country's strategy for development and defining development not merely as accumulating national wealth but as benefiting each person in more than economic terms. Mr. Gore is engaged in a belated attempt at bridge-building. The politics of population has shifted greatly over the years. Several decades ago, when concern over the accelerating increases began to be audible in the rich countries, the poor ones suspiciously wondered whether it wasn't all a plot to keep them small and weak. Since then they have discovered, to their sorrow, that sky-high population growth can destroy any hope of escaping poverty. For a time governments looked to rising incomes to curb birth rates but learned that usually the birth rates have to come down to get the incomes up. Then the development agencies began paying closer attention to the status of women. Some years ago the World Bank pointed out that the cheapest way to reduce a developing country's infant mortality rate is to teach the girls to read. Lowering infant deaths is an important step in the process of persuading people to have fewer babies. Throughout a wide range of cultures there is a reliable correlation between more education for women and lower birth rates. The Cairo conference begins on Sept. 5 and, if it goes as Mr. Gore hopes, it will encourage national policies that tie all of those elements together -- development, family-planning services, better health care especially for mothers and children, more education especially for girls.\n",

      " The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Baltimore Sun:. There is considerable irony in the fact that as nations around the world have steadily moved toward consensus on matters related to reproductive health and freedom, dissident voices are attempting to paint this widespread agreement as coercive imperialism. If they are right, then it is a coercion arrived at with remarkable ease. As the United Nations' International Conference on Population and Development convenes in Cairo Monday, only about 10 percent of the language in the draft ``Program of Action'' is in dispute. It is one measure of the dissent that one of the terms in dispute is ``safe motherhood,'' because the Vatican -- represented at the conference both as a religious institution and as a state with diplomatic recognition -- fears that the term could be construed to imply support of abortion. Despite the fears of the Vatican and its allies, this conference is not about abortion, and certainly not about coercion. The document does not mention growth targets, nor even discredited terms like ``population control,'' largely because those concepts are at odds with the respect for individual dignity that the document upholds. Beyond that consideration, those who have worked in family planning programs can attest to the fact that ``targets'' and ``controls'' simply are not an effective way of stabilizing rates of population growth. The Cairo conference focuses instead on more immediate goals --  improving access to contraceptives and reproductive health care, reducing maternal and infant mortality, educating and empowering women, reducing poverty, achieving sustainable development and a more equitable distribution of the world's resources. Behind those goals lies widespread agreement that the only realistic way of achieving population stability is by improving living conditions of people around the world, a goal that includes giving them control over their own fertility. Enemies of the Cairo conference dispute the demand for contraceptives, but the evidence suggests that millions of women and men are eager, even desperate, for reliable means of preventing pregnancy. One telling fact is the millions -- 50 million to 60 million by one estimate -- of abortions performed around the world each year, many of them so unsafe that 250,000 women die annually. Unless people are given that freedom, we can look forward to a world far more crowded than today. In 1994, world population stands at 5.6 billion, and growing at the rate of 90 million each year. Most of that growth is coming in countries already too poor to feed the people they have.\n",

      " Clinton May Request Reservists for Haiti (Washn). President Clinton may have to ask ``several hundred'' military reservists to go on active duty to take part in any invasion of Haiti, senior U.S. officials said Monday, amid planning that included a ``walk-through'' exercise by top aides of the proposed military action. As military plans went forward, Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, made the case for use of U.S. power in Haiti by saying that the nation's ``essential reliability'' was at stake. ``Having exhausted all other remedies, we must make it clear that we mean what we say'' about removing Haiti's military leaders, Lake said in a speech here Monday night to the Council on Foreign Relations. ``Our actions in Haiti will send a message far beyond our region, to all who seriously threaten our interests.'' Lake listed American credibility as the first of four reasons for why the United States must move beyond sanctions to military force if the Haitian generals refuse to step down. Haiti is also a test of U.S. commitments to defend democracy, to prevent further destabilization in the region and resulting flights of refugees, and to curb ``gross abuses of human rights,'' he said. In related developments, the administration has begun intensive consultations on Haiti with key leaders on Capitol Hill, aimed at heading off growing restiveness about the wisdom of an invasion, officials said. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that 17 countries, including Israel and three Western European nations, have agreed to contribute a total of at least 1,500 troops and police personnel to help a U.S.-led invasion force after it has secured control of Haiti. And the aircraft carrier USS America will sail later this week to Haitian waters, Defense officials said. It will be the second carrier slated for Haitian duty, joining the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The administration is considering several options for activating military reserves for Haitian duty but Clinton has not yet been presented with them, a senior official said. Use of reservists would likely be necessary because restructuring of the armed forces has caused reservist functions in such areas as logistics and support to be integrated closely with the operations of active-duty units.\n",

      "Real Life on the Teen Mommy Track. Fourteen-year-old Angela is thinking of having a baby. She doesn't say so directly, and it doesn't seem about to happen tomorrow, but the South Bronx youngster smiles coyly at the question. ``I love babies,'' she says sweetly. ``They're so cute. My mother already told me, `If you get pregnant, you won't have an abortion. You'll have the baby, and your grandmother and I will help out.' '' What about school or making sure the baby has a father? ``I want to be a lawyer ... or maybe a teacher. Why do I need to worry about a father? My mother raised me and my sister just fine without one.'' Angela seems likely to become one of the nearly half-million teenagers who give birth each year in the United States. About two-thirds of them are unmarried; many are poor. Americans debating welfare reform and the state of the family have no shortage of opinions about the cause of the problem: welfare dependency, low self-esteem, economic decline, ignorance about birth control. But how well do these theories reflect the actual experiences of teenagers? To get a clearer picture of the problem, I spoke with some 30 new or expectant young mothers living in the inner city, and sometimes with their boyfriends, nurses, teachers and social workers. (To protect their privacy, I've identified the teenagers only by their first names.) It gradually became evident that, though they vary in degrees of poverty and family disorder, these girls all live in a distinct subculture with its own values, beliefs and sexual mores. To date, efforts at reform don't seem to recognize this reality. Sociologists sometimes use the term ``life script'' to refer to the timing and progression of the major events most people expect in their lives. The typical middle-class American script is familiar: childhood, adolescence, beginning of work and, only then, marriage and childbearing. But for most of the teens I spoke with, this script is unrecognizable. The mainstream rites of maturity -- college, first apartment, first serious job -- hold little emotional meaning. Many have vague career aspirations, but few dream of living on their own. All view marriage as irrelevant. To these girls, the only thing that symbolizes maturity is a baby.\n",

Gingrich expanded his proposed alternatives to federal antipoverty programs by suggesting tax credits to encourage charitable donations to help the poor and saying he preferred the welfare revisions that governors have proposed over those in the Gingrich-inspired ``Contract with America.'' He similarly called for loosening federal control over Medicaid, the state-federal health program for the poorest Americans. Three weeks from becoming the first Republican speaker in 40 years, Gingrich also endorsed a term limit of eight years on speakers, similar to the restriction that the Constitution imposes on presidents. Besides his proposals on specific federal policies, Gingrich sketched out his views on broader issues of government, economics and race during a two-hour luncheon with Washington Post editors and reporters. The former history professor studded his responses with verbal footnotes to the books of historians. ``I'm not anti-government,'' Gingrich declared in explaining his opposition to the ``Great Society'' programs of the 1960s. ``I don't believe social engineering works.

An utterly peaceful two-day election in Namibia last week capped a year of astonishing democratic and economic gains in southern Africa, a long-blighted region that now offers dramatic hope for a crippled continent. In Namibia's first post-independence election, the incumbent president, Sam Nujoma, and his ruling party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, swept nearly 72 percent of the vote in the former South African colony, a sparsely populated nation twice the size of California. ``We are fighters,'' announced Nujoma, a former guerrilla leader. But the new enemies ``are poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance.'' Bullets, not ballots, are usually associated with a continent dominated by numbing news of famine, brutal ethnic wars, disabling corruption, the anarchy of Zaire and Somalia, and the genocidal horrors of Rwanda. The continental economic slide has been so severe that most Africans are poorer today than they were in the mid-1970s, according to the World Bank. But the successful election in Namibia added to evidence that political reconciliation and multi-party democracy are inexorably spreading over the vast southern third of Africa after decades of bitter racial strife and a series of devastating wars fueled by Cold War rivalries.\n",

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo censured the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and asked for federal help in resolving ``hundreds of complaints by Filipinos of rape, forced prostitution, physical and mental abuse and non-payment of salaries.'' In one documented case, a 25-year-old Filipina who was promised a job as a hotel accountant on Rota said her employer instead put her to work as a maid in a secluded ranch house, held her there against her will and repeatedly raped, sodomized and beat her over a three-week period until she managed to escape on Sept 6. Macapagal-Arroyo, a former Georgetown University classmate of Clinton's, urged the president and Congress to ``cut off federal aid'' and take control of immigration there. Another senator, Ernesto Herrera, called for Washington to help end ``wanton disregard for the welfare and protection of migrant workers'' on the tiny Pacific islands, the biggest of which are Saipan, Tinian and Rota.\n",

      "In Haiti, Substitute Jobs for Aid \n",
      " Stephen S. Cohen is a professor at the University \n",
      " of California, Berkeley.. Left to itself, there is little reason to think that the Haitian economy will substantially improve. It is, by far, the poorest place in the Western Hemisphere, one of the poorest in the world, and it has been so for a long time. Even if we have finally stopped a long string of dictators from simply looting the place, as they have done again and again, there still will not be jobs. Haiti lacks the basic ingredients that have propelled once-poor Asian nations into rapid development: education, infrastructure, a functioning social structure, competent government, entrepreneurship, an industrial base to build upon, rapid productivity increases in agriculture. Should we just leave a check and get out? We can. We can call it developmental aid and mean what we say. But pumping substantial governmental aid into the island will not produce real jobs, and it will not drive development. Because the situation in Haiti is so particularly desperate, some of the funds will simply go into feeding the population and providing rudimentary medical services. The developmental part will typically consist of investing the aid funds into infrastructure -- roads, schools, health facilities -- and the care and feeding of a bureaucracy to run them, a bureaucracy associated with a patronage system to dish out the jobs and cream off the contracts. We would do much better by the people of Haiti, and at less cost to ourselves, if we were to substitute jobs for aid. And the easiest way to ship jobs to Haiti, jobs that fit with the labor force and wage structure of the island, is to shift to Haiti a small but substantial (by the standards of a little island) amount of the U.S. quota on apparel imports. Currently, access to the U.S. market for foreign producers of garments is limited by a system of quotas. The lion's share of those quotas is held, and treated almost as a property right, by the not-so-poor-anymore nations of Asia-Pacific, including places such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea, where national income is well over 10 times that of Haiti. Typically in places like Hong Kong, there is an auction system. They get the quotas free, then sell them to the highest bidder, who sometimes, illegally, makes the products in China and the labels in the country of the quota.\n",

      "The Minimum Wage Doesn't Merit a Raise \n",
      " Malkin is a doctoral fellow in Santa Monica, Calif.. The Clinton administration has rung in the new year with an old idea: raising the minimum wage. In an attempt to raise low-wage workers' incomes through social engineering, the administration has indicated that it will push to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour. The proposal is sure to spark sharp debate about whether the minimum wage destroys jobs. This aspect of the discussion will overshadow an even more fundamental question: Does minimum-wage legislation accomplish its objective? Does it really help poor people? Half a century ago, the answer to that question probably would have been ``yes.'' In the 1940s, most minimum-wage workers lived in poverty. The minimum wage was thus a well-targeted and effective anti-poverty device. Over the past several decades, however, the minimum-wage population has evolved. According to economists Michael Horrigan and Ron Mincy, the income distribution of minimum-wage workers is almost identical to the income distribution of the population as a whole. Today only one in seven minimum-wage workers lives in a poor household; most of the rest are middle-class teen-agers or wives in pursuit of a little extra income. Thus the benefit from a minimum-wage hike would go mostly to middle- and upper-income families. The Clinton administration has perpetuated the myth that there is an army of working poor people in the United States. A 1987 Congressional Budget Office study suggests otherwise. That report showed that in the entire United States, only 120,000 minimum-wage employees work full-time year-round yet also are poor. That's less than 3 percent of the minimum-wage population and only about 1/10th of 1 percent of the total labor force.\n",

      "New Assault on Poverty May Also Face a Backlash (Baltimore) \n",
      " Hall is a columnist for The Evening Sun.. The recent three-part PBS documentary, ``America's War On Poverty,'' raises interesting questions for cities such as Baltimore, which just became one of six urban areas to receive a $100 million cash grant from the federal government to revitalize deteriorating neighborhoods. That money and an additional $225 million in tax credits for local businesses are supposed to trigger another $800 million in city, state and private funds. Although city officials are careful not to say so, this new effort is very reminiscent of the anti-poverty effort that grew out of President Johnson's vision of a Great Society. The money will be used for economic development in some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods; for education and job training, crime control and community-based health care. Even the name of the program --  Empowerment Zones -- smacks of 1960s rhetoric. A goal of LBJ's Great Society, after all, was the ``economic empowerment'' of the disenfranchised. But isn't that effort widely regarded today as a failure? Doesn't conventional wisdom now hold that government cannot just throw money at social problems and expect them to go away? Haven't we conceded that ours is not such a great society after all and that if we declare war on poverty again, we're likely to lose? The answer to those questions is yes. But ``America's War On Poverty,'' produced by Henry Hampton, the same man who did the award-winning documentary on the civil rights movement, ``Eyes On the Prize,'' offers a different perspective on the Johnson years. For one thing, we are reminded that the War on Poverty was very short-lived. LBJ declared war in 1964 and Congress set up the first of the anti-poverty programs the following year. But those federal decrees met with fierce opposition on the local level almost immediately. By 1966, Congress was dismantling some programs --  particularly those that sought to ``empower'' the poor -- and cutting funding on others. In 1968, Richard Nixon was elected to the White House, and the disembowelment of LBJ's Great Society was pursued in earnest.\n",

      "School Lunch Program Shouldn't be Changed. Schoolchildren who are too hungry to concentrate on learning would be the product of the House Republicans' overly ambitious effort to ``reform'' the national school lunch program. As part of its welfare reform package, the GOP would turn the federal child nutrition programs into block grants, reduce the funding and give control to states. The justification is that this would make the programs more ``flexible.'' The more probable effect would be to increase hunger among the most innocent and powerless -- children. This is not what voters were clamoring for when they voted for change in November. The block grant plan, which gained steam Thursday when it was approved by the House Economic Opportunities Committee, makes no provision for growth in times of recession. Nor does it compensate for any increase in population or poverty. When states would run out of money, children would run out of food. Is this what America wants? This isn't the first time Republicans have taken aim at school lunches in a misguided effort to save money. In 1981, the Reagan administration absurdly tried to categorize ketchup as a vegetable. Fortunately that blunder triggered howls -- and so should this current effort to undo a federal program that works. House Speaker Newt Gingrich argues that the proposed legislative change would remove cumbersome federal red tape and allow the states to do a better job. History does not support this argument. In the past, ``states' rights'' often meant separate and unequal treatment. Under the states' welfare programs, before President Franklin D. Roosevelt federalized aid to dependent children, some poor mothers and their children got enough while others got little or nothing. The proposal also makes big claims about flexibility. Actually, there's flexibility in the program now. Could there be more? Sure, but the GOP effort is less about flexibility than gutting hunger programs. The plan also would eliminate federal standards. The National Academy of Sciences would develop new voluntary standards. Volunteerism in this regard would only promote unequal treatment from state to state.\n",

Police raided the hilltop estate of Winnie Mandela in Soweto Wednesday, looking for and finding, detectives said, documents corroborating an ongoing corruption investigation against the 60-year-old woman who kept the flame while her husband served nearly three decades in apartheid jails. The accusations concerned a kickback of about $21,000 that Winnie Mandela allegedly received from a developer keen on government contracts to build homes for the poor. She also stands accused of abuse of office in a scheme that, with her daughter and her personal physician allegedly acting as fronts, would give her controlling shares of the construction company. There have been no formal charges as yet. A spokesman said that Winnie Mandela, a junior minister in her husband's multiparty Cabinet, was the victim of an outrageous lie and has instructed her attorneys to sue the police. But the ruling African National Congress, whose leadership councils include her, quickly distanced itself from Winnie Mandela, saying tersely that ``this is a matter for the police.'' The accused was 3,000 miles away in West Africa, on an official trip to a film festival that had been forbidden by the president. Upon her return Thursday, a senior aide to President Nelson Mandela told Newsday Wednesday, Winnie Mandela will almost certainly be fired by the president, from whom she has been separated since April 13, 1992. ``The reason the president didn't want Winnie to go abroad was that he wanted to sack her, and he wanted to tell her face to face,'' said the aide, who asked not to be identified. ``It is unfortunate that this development occurred before he could take that decision, but he plans to go ahead.'' A presidential spokesman said Nelson Mandela had been informed by the police that his wife was under investigation.\n",

Runyon for greater pricing authority, arguing this week that the Postal Service had ignored initiatives that would have given Runyon some of the control he wants from Congress. Asked at a hearing why the Postal Service had failed to act, Gleiman told the House Postal Service subcommittee: ``Let's say they had other fish to fry.'' Calling the service ``a $54 billion gorilla,'' Gleiman said he was stunned to learn that some senior Runyon aides were unaware of efforts to change prices more rapidly and shorten the 10-month rate setting process. A Postal Service-Rate Commission task force approved the initiatives in June 1992, shortly before Runyon took office. Last week Runyon asked the subcommittee for greater authority over personnel, pricing and products, saying he was frustrated by a rate-making process that takes longer than having a baby. Gleiman, however, accused the Postal Service of providing the commission with poor and inaccurate statistics. He also suggested that the recently approved 32-cent first-class stamp might have been less if the commission had known the Postal Service's projected costs for workers-compensation claims were inflated. Despite his criticisms, Gleiman remained optimistic he and Runyon would resolve their differences without new legislation.\n",

In what is being billed as the largest gathering of world leaders in U.N. history, about 20,000 delegates from 180 countries converged Sunday on Copenhagen for what promises to be a weeklong wrangle over the best ways to fight poverty. ``Absolute poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy are the lot of one-fifth of the world's population,'' said U.N.

      "Aristide Turns to Privatization in Haiti (Port-au-Prince). For decades, Haiti's state-owned enterprises have been used as cash cows by whatever government was in power, while a small group of family-run monopolies controlled most of the nation's private economy. Now President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, although long classified as an opponent of privatization, is preparing a radical program to rid the government of the cost and corruption of nine state-owned companies while seeking to avoid further concentration of wealth in the hands of Haiti's traditional economic elite. Under Aristide's plan, backed by the World Bank, the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government would allow foreign investment in the nine state enterprises, including the telephone and electrical systems and the main port facilities, while excluding local moneyed interests from participation. The plan, its supporters say, is an attempt to deal with some root causes of Haiti's chronic poverty and the legacy that has left the nation the poorest in the hemisphere with the most skewed income distribution. Although granting foreign investors a stake in the Haitian firms would not guarantee that Haiti's mid-level business class also could gain a share of ownership, proponents of the privatization plan say revitalization of the firms would create new jobs and provide the infrastructure needed to lure more large-scale foreign investment.\n",

What to do if you're already the world's largest foreign aid donor per capita but have thousands of foreign dignitaries and television cameras in town and want to make a big international splash? Denmark answered that question last week when it announced it will cancel the debts of five very poor countries. The announcement came during the biggest assembly of world leaders and their entourages in U.N. history, the World Summit for Social Development, meeting in Copenhagen. Angola, Ghana, Nicaragua, Zimbabwe and Bolivia will have their debts to Denmark erased, while Egypt's debt will be cut in half. ``The Danish initiative is perhaps not large in relation to the total debt burden of the developing countries,'' said Denmark's minister for development cooperation, Poul Nielson. ``But I hope that (it) will inspire other donor countries, and not the least their representatives in the World Bank and other international financial institutions.'' It's a long shot, of course, to expect the Danish example to set off a chain reaction in the industrialized world, which has long looked at debt forgiveness with extreme aversion.

      "Short-Term Problems, Long-Term Potential for Mexico \n",
      " The following editorial appeared in Monday's Los Angeles Times:. The price of restoring investor confidence in the battered Mexican economy has again gone up sharply -- and this time the costs will be borne most heavily by the Mexican people. The government of President Ernesto Zedillo last week announced a tough new austerity program, which the financial community has received as just the harsh medicine the Mexican economy needs if it is to recover for the long term. But in the short run it will mean recession and unemployment. Under the new austerity plan, announced Thursday by Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, government spending will be slashed and electricity and gasoline prices will rise sharply. This is sure to push the Mexican economy further into recession. But the government will also draw on international credits to help bolster its banks and provide aid to the poor. The minimum wage will go up 10 percent in April, hardly enough to keep up with an inflation rate projected at 42 percent for this year. The dose of economic austerity was needed to stabilize the peso, which has been dropping since it was first devalued last December, as well as to foster U.S. support for the international aid package that Washington crafted for Mexico. At least as far as the peso is concerned, the new program seemed to have the intended effect almost immediately, with the currency's value rising slightly Friday to 6.28 to the dollar after five straight days of record lows. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had it about right when he told the Senate Banking Committee on Friday, ``We should recognize the political courage in taking these steps.'' Indeed, the political and social disruptions likely to follow the onerous austerity plan will test President Zedillo, not to mention hard-pressed Mexican citizens. Unlike the government's initial austerity measures, announced in January, the new steps do not include an agreement of cooperation from labor and business leaders. This is an apparent rupture of Mexico's longstanding pacto, as the system of negotiating economic targets and policies among government, labor and business is called. And that could portend more political infighting in Mexico, already reeling from the economic crisis and from political scandals. But if the political problems do not get out of hand -- and so far Zedillo is handling those too with remarkable courage -- the corrective economic policies should help buttress an economy that is fundamentally sound but is suffering from over-dependence on foreign capital. Too much of that foreign capital is controlled by investors seeking short-term gains rather than long-term growth. While that is understandable from an investor's point of view, what Mexico needs is long-term investment as its economy evolves in partnership with its North American Free Trade Agreement co-signatories -- Canada and the United States. The long view must be kept by decision makers both in Washington and California over the next couple of years as this country experiences a predicted drop in bilateral trade and a possible increase in illegal immigration across our southern border.\n",

      " Moran is a professor of sociology at Mount Holyoke College in \n",
      " South Hadley, Mass.. The 1980s was a decade of trickle-down economics. During this period, the rich got richer, the poor got both poorer and more numerous (an additional 7 million people have fallen below the poverty line) and the middle class shrunk. While inflation has been brought under control, the unemployment rate still remains at about 5.6 percent. It might be time to think about developing a new economic theory. Most of us are familiar with trickle-down economics: Large tax cuts will put more money into the hands of corporations and wealthy individuals who will invest in job-creating industries. The accumulation of wealth at the top will gradually trickle down to those at the bottom. But there are a lot of people at the bottom (and many in the middle) still waiting for the money to start trickling down. I would like to propose a new economic theory, the ``percolate-up'' theory: The best way to stimulate the economy and increase the standard of living is to put more money into the hands of the poor. Countless studies have shown that poor people spend a greater proportion of their income than do rich people. More spending requires more production, more production requires more employment and this in turn will generate more demand, stimulate more production and create even more employment. Consumers, not producers, will generate the energy for economic growth. Thus the benefits of putting more money into the hands of the poor will gradually percolate up through the middle class and beyond. But how do we put more money in the hands of the poor? The traditional way has been to increase government transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare). But increased government spending will only add to the growing federal deficit, which is neither politically feasible nor financially wise. An alternative is to raise the minimum wage, which would stimulate the economy without adding to the federal deficit. Indeed, raising the minimum wage should decrease the deficit because it would increase tax revenues and reduce the cost of government assistance to the poor.\n",

      "The Real Sickness Behind Ebola. Blood, body wastes and political corruption spread the deadly Ebola virus in Zaire. This African country is a failed state, not because of natural disasters but because President Sese Seko Mobutu has plundered a national wealth stemming from offshore oil and other minerals. He has stashed away millions in foreign banks. Despite a substantial manufacturing base, real wages in Zaire have declined steadily since independence more than 30 years ago. Blame the corruption, which drives away foreign investment and inflates the cost of doing business. Blame Cold War politics, too. Mobutu and others capitalized on U.S.-Soviet rivalries and grew fat off all who would pay up. Washington ended its aid to Mobutu in 1992, allowing only a trickle of emergency relief for his countrymen, but corruption continues, destroying jobs and impoverishing countless Zairians. The desperate poverty makes the country ripe for public health emergencies. Clean running water is scarce. Medication and basic supplies like gloves and needles required for good sanitation are generally in short supply at hospitals. These conditions provide fertile breeding grounds for illnesses like the Ebola virus and AIDS. The paying of bribes has allowed some people exposed to the Ebola virus to cross roadblocks and escape the quarantine. Their travel threatens the capital, Kinshasa -- and perhaps the world. The United States Agency for International Development has sent two teams from the Centers for Disease Control, and other international health organizations too have responded with compassion. The wealthier nations should also nurture Zaire's long-term development via humanitarian channels. Reducing infant mortality remains a priority because 50 percent of Zaire's children die before the age of 5. Huge cuts in non-political aid to Africa, as currently considered by Congress, would sentence many youngsters to die across the continent.\n",

A Hall aide said that the proposed compromise, first outlined during a Rules Committee meeting Thursday, would restore $150 million to the Development Fund for Africa, $100 million in other humanitarian aid and maintain the independence of the Agency for International Development (AID) and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency at least until a bipartisan commission concludes a one-year study. Under broad legislation that Clinton has threatened to veto, those two agencies and the United States Information Agency would be absorbed into the State Department. The Africa fund would be reduced about $173 million, while humanitarian assistance channeled through nonprofit agencies would decrease by $443 million. Hall said he suggested to International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., after the Rules Committee meeting that the additional $250 million be offset by reductions in military assistance and economic aid to governments. Despite the general unpopularity of foreign aid, Hall said that development or humanitarian assistance was worthwhile. ``It's good aid. It helps poor people,'' Hall said. ``If you put AID under the State Department, you'll get political decisions on funds to the poor.''\n",

      "Spending Cuts Package Stalls Unexpectedly (Washn). Opposition from two liberal senators unexpectedly stalled final action Friday on a $16.4 billion spending cuts package that represented a major accord between the White House and the GOP Congress. Instead of obtaining passage of the bill and sending it on for President Clinton's signature, an obviously irked Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., pulled the bill from consideration at least until Congress reconvenes July 10 following the Independence Day recess. Asked later if the bill was dead, Dole snapped, ``I'm not going to worry about it any more. Let Clinton worry about it.'' The measure cancels $16.4 billion of previously approved spending commitments, but provides new funds for California earthquake relief, natural disasters in 40 states, new counter-terrorism units and U.S. aid to the nation of Jordan. The compromise, which the House passed Thursday night, was the result of nearly a month of intense negotiations between the White House and GOP leaders. Dole blamed Friday's delay on stalling and political posturing by Sens. Paul D. Wellstone, D-Minn., and Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.

      " economic adviser to the president.. Until very recently, a deep bipartisan consensus has given force to the propositions that any American who can work should work, and that no one who works hard should end up destitute. But now Congress threatens to abandon long-held common ground on the central value of work. More than those of most nations, our social safety net has been woven deliberately into the world of work. To make work pay for all Americans, Social Security retirement and disability are provided in exchange for work. A national minimum sets a floor on wages. Instead of giveaways, our anti-hunger programs hinge on food stamps -- vouchers incorporating subsidies that phase out gradually as earnings rise rather than stopping suddenly when a recipient gets a job. Medicaid has been expanded over time to cover more children of the working poor. This same consensus has long supported national investments in education and job training, and in unemployment insurance and job search assistance, in order to equip all Americans with the tools they need to get ahead on their own. Another striking manifestation of the bipartisan consensus to make work pay has been the earned income tax credit, which Ronald Reagan called ``the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of the Congress.'' The EITC uses the tax code to amplify the incentives to work, boosting the incomes of the working poor while signaling our national preference for work over passive dependency. The EITC was expanded under President Reagan in 1986, President Bush in 1990 and President Clinton in 1993. This national commitment to rewarding work has gained even greater urgency in recent years as many Americans have found themselves working harder for less. The new economy is more demanding and less forgiving than the old. Between 1979 and 1993, average real weekly earnings fell by 26 percent for male high-school dropouts and by 18 percent for men whose schooling stopped with a high-school diploma. For women, real earnings fell 9 percent for high-school dropouts and stagnated for those who only finished high school. (Nearly half of all American workers have a high school education or less.)\n",

      " Nobel Prize in economics.. Welfare penalizes work and does too little to discourage births out of wedlock and migration to ``generous'' states. This triad of perversities was not discovered yesterday by radical Republicans --  reformers in both political parties were proposing corrective measures a quarter of a century ago. The proper task of welfare reform is to introduce effective inducements for constructive behavior, while protecting vulnerable recipients from punitive measures. Such inducements come in two brands: sticks and carrots. Current practice relies too heavily on sticks. Today's ``reforms'' would only sharpen the sticks: depriving welfare moms and their kids of benefits if they stay on AFDC too long, if they give birth too often and too young, if they don't work. Such proposals include no carrots for work or marriage. Instead, Republicans propose to cut the earned income tax credit, job training, child care and other programs that encourage transition from welfare to work. Such proposed cuts are especially foolish because they would aggravate existing perverse penalties exacted on welfare recipients who choose to work. Implicit in Aid to Families With Dependent Children, our nation's most visible and controversial program of public aid, are marginal taxes of 100 percent or higher on earnings --  many recipients lose a dollar of AFDC check for every dollar they earn, and may lose Medicaid coverage as well. These extremes are somewhat moderated by food stamps and the earned income tax subsidy to low-income workers. Such confiscatory policies reflect a longstanding Catch-22: Americans seem willing to spend money only to save the poorest from complete destitution. The perverse consequence is to impose large work disincentives on the beneficiaries. To save money, Republicans in the early 1980s eliminated rules that allowed recipients to keep a third of their earnings. The result was virtually a 100 percent tax on working AFDC recipients. The poor face far higher marginal tax rates than are considered tolerable for the richest Americans.\n",

The department's overseas autos average out at eight years old; Cadillacs are heavy enough to carry the requisite armor plate. These cheap shots mark a know-nothing assault on the administration's foreign-policy budget. And Phil Gramm wants to be president. No doubt the budget was ripe for pruning. The end of the Cold War compelled a review. Foreign affairs has had to bear a share of deficit reduction. But the State Department already was deep into a program to trim spending 20 percent to 25 percent by 2002 -- it's reduced staff by 1,300 in two years. A one-year whack of 12 percent is outlandish. The cuts in American payments to the international organizations and for peacekeeping are even more severe. Meanwhile, foreign aid spending is being reduced 18 percent below presidential request; that includes the crucial sums to the development banks that leverage contributions by others. It may be hard to defend each one of the 50 (additional) posts abroad that Congress would close. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher is right to prize ``universal'' representation. It serves the American claim -- one asserted by the Republicans even as they torpedo it -- to provide world leadership and follow an internationalist path. It enables the United States to tend to its far-flung citizens and interests. It facilitates preventive diplomacy. Having an ambassador in Burundi, for instance, saved lives. Wasting the arms control agency mocks the surpassing strategic interest in weapons nonproliferation.

It would be wrong to strip children of or weaken current ensured help for their daily survival and during economic recessions and natural disasters, as both the Senate and House bills will do. It would be wrong to exacerbate rather than alleviate the current shameful and epidemic child poverty that no decent, rich nation should tolerate for even one child. Both the Senate and House welfare bills are morally and practically indefensible. Rather than solve widespread child deprivation, they simply shift the burden onto states and localities with far fewer federal resources, weakened state maintenance of effort and little or no state accountability. As you well know, these block grants are not designed primarily to help children or to make families more self-sufficient. They are Trojan Horses for massive budget cuts and for imposing an ideological agenda that says that government assistance for the poor and children should be dismantled and cut while government assistance for wealthy individuals and corporations should be maintained and even increased. Do you think the Old Testament prophets Isaiah, Micah and Amos -- or Jesus Christ -- would support such policies?\n",

      "Childrens' Health at Greatest Risk in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the cradle of the human race, the African lands south of the Sahara, the lives of the young are in greatest jeopardy. Cycles of famine and civil war, along with corrupt governments and attendant political instability, compound other factors that gnaw at a child's chances for survival: poverty, malnutrition, poor hygiene, tropical environments favorable to disease. Malaria, meningitis and parasites are added local threats. In four countries -- Niger, Mali, Guinea and Malawi -- more than half the married women have lost at least one child. In the United Nations Children's Fund's worldwide ranking of mortality among those younger than 5, no fewer than 18 of the 20 worst-performing countries are in Africa. Statistically, babies born in sparsely populated Niger are the unluckiest of all: Almost a third do not live past their fifth birthday. On Africa's Horn, another nightmare scenario seems to be fast coming true, one that etches the poignant contrasts between poor and rich nations. On March 3, U.N. peacekeepers bade good riddance to chaos- and famine-racked Somalia, leaving rival clans to squabble for power there. A measles epidemic caused thousands of children to die in 1991-92. A replay appears to have begun; aid workers in November reported hundreds of measles cases among newborns to 2-year-olds. The outside world, which poured at least $2 billion into the failed U.S.-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, seems in no hurry to sink more money into humanitarian operations.\n",

      " Policy Priorities, a research and policy institute.. When examining a controversial issue, the first task is to get the facts straight. James K. Glassman's recent assaults on the beleaguered earned income tax credit (EITC) fail this test. In a recent Washington Post column, Glassman calls the credit ``a dubious program'' that ``often deters work rather than promoting it.'' In an earlier column, he attacks it on a number of counts. This is a matter of no small importance. The EITC, in which Congress proposes substantial cuts, is the nation's principal response to eroding wages for low-paid workers. It offsets income and payroll taxes for low- and moderate-income working families, and supplements the wages of the working poor to lift them closer to the poverty line. In so doing, it also helps make work more rewarding than welfare. The EITC shouldn't escape scrutiny, but Glassman's unbridled attack veers far off course. Consider his treatment of four key issues. -- Excessive Growth: Glassman calls the credit ``the fastest growing entitlement'' and ``a program gone bonkers,'' and says Republicans are simply trying to restrain its out-of-control growth. In fact, the program is not out of control. It has grown over the past decade because presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton led successful, deliberate and mostly bipartisan efforts to expand it. After the 1993 expansion is phased in fully next year, this growth stops. Congressional Budget Office data show that EITC costs will rise only 4 percent a year between 1997 and 2005 (all because of inflation and population growth) and that the EITC will rank 12th in rate of growth among the 15 largest entitlements during this period. Glassman's claim that budget cuts are needed to avoid spiraling cost increases is incorrect.\n",

In a nationally televised address, his first major public appearance since being hospitalized Oct. 26 for a heart ailment, Yeltsin heaped scorn on the Communist Party, which polls show is in a commanding lead position in the balloting for the 450-seat lower house of parliament, the State Duma. Yeltsin also criticized some of Russia's hard-line nationalist parties and leaders, although he did not mention them by name in the pre-taped address, which was broadcast on state-controlled television. ``We traveled for more than 70 years along the road to which they want to return us,'' Yeltsin said of the Communists. ``The experience of many, many years, of several generations, compels us to admit that neither a plan, nor rigid price regulation, will bring us salvation.'' ``The command economy has never functioned well and never will,'' he said. ``No command by a general will raise such an economy either.

      "Public Housing Being Built in Affluent Dallas Neighborhoods \n",
      " (Dallas). For more than 40 years, the West Dallas projects have stood for two troubling things: the past fashion of placing public housing in the nation's poorest neighborhoods, and the sharp racial divisions that still endure in this very southern city. But fashions change and West Dallas, with the formal, forgotten name of Lake West, is about to enter a new era. Under federal court order, the Dallas Housing Authority is largely dismantling the barracks-like housing project, which has been home to the city's poorest blacks. In its place, smaller complexes will be built, tucked into more prosperous neighborhoods, part of a trend being championed nationwide by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros. In Dallas, that means upsetting the longtime racial and economic patterns of the city -- blacks and the poor to the south of the dusty Trinity River, whites and the middle-class to the north. As much of the eyesore of West Dallas comes tumbling down, another challenging question remains: Where will its people go next? ``We can't duplicate anymore what we did in Lake West and Cabrini-Green (housing project in Chicago). We just can't,'' said Alphonso Jackson, president and chief executive officer of the Dallas Housing Authority. ``We've got to integrate people in small developments in middle- and upper-income areas, because I believe philosophically that once public housing residents see people doing something with their lives, it inspires them. If you're in poverty and all you see is poverty, logic shows that all you're going to do in life is poverty.'' Since May, the housing agency has been making one of its first forays into the suburbs, planning to build 75 units on eight acres in what has been dubbed Far North Dallas -- an area of $110,000 to $200,000 homes owned by teachers, computer consultants and accountants. Representatives of 14 homeowners associations in the area immediately objected, saying they learned of the pending project only through newspaper reports. But they were instantly worried, they said, about the impact on property values, about the safety of the housing project children on the heavily traveled streets, and about the lack of public transportation and low-income medical services for the new residents.\n",

      " of New York State.. The raging national debate over welfare has taken on an Alice in Wonderland quality to it. While everyone agrees that the welfare system should be reformed to help participants move into jobs, our state and federal officials act as if we can find jobs for everyone merely by imposing time limits and cutting benefits. Conspicuously absent from the debate has been an analysis of the shortcomings of the economy. Wages for most workers in the United States have fallen since the mid-1970s, while the gap between the rich and the rest of us has increased. The richest 10 percent of Americans makes nearly six times the income of the poorest. The welfare changes being promoted by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, President Clinton and New York Gov. George Pataki would accelerate these trends, while increasing childhood poverty, hunger and homelessness. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., told his Senate colleagues to remember their vote on welfare when the sight of children sleeping in the streets becomes common within the next decade. Politicians need to be held accountable on welfare reform. They need to document how many welfare recipients they expect to move into the labor force, how many jobs are available and how they intend to create jobs to fill the gap. The State Department of Labor reports that in November there were nearly 8 million jobs in New York. The official unemployment rate was 6 percent, with 512,000 people ``officially'' out of work and looking for employment; the real number of unemployed is higher. The labor department estimates New York added only 60,000 new net jobs last year -- 90,000 in the private sector, with a loss of 30,000 government jobs. Projected funding cuts at the federal, state and local level will continue to increase government layoffs. Of the jobs created, only 25,000 were in the entry level positions welfare participants are most likely to obtain. Even when you add in job openings due to retirement or a worker leaving to care for a family member, New York is more than half a million jobs short of making ``welfare to work'' succeed.\n",

      "Burundi Being Torn Apart by Ethnic Violence (Bujumbura, Burundi). Six times in two years Bonaventure Manirakiza has fled his home, driven each time to escape from the seemingly ceaseless wave of ethnic cleansing that is sweeping this Central African nation. When Tutsi militias began attacking and killing city Hutus like him in October 1993, the 29-year-old secretary first moved out of his Bujumbura neighborhood to Kigali, the Rwandan capital. But ethnic conflict there drove him back to Burundi in January 1994 and he has moved around four more times as suburb after suburb fell to Tutsi purists seeking to create a haven for their own. He lives, at least for now, in the village of Gatumba, near the Zaire border, a condition he bears because ``I must save my life.'' With their control of the national army, and with the aid of militias, the Tutsi have cleared Bujumbura of almost all Hutus, most of whom have headed into the hills surrounding the city, or fled by the thousands across the border into Zaire. Entire neighborhoods resemble ghost towns, and fear grips the city, which no longer allows Manirakiza, part of the country's Hutu majority, to live in his hometown. Fearful of the kind of genocide that decimated the Tutsi population in neighboring Rwanda in 1994, and unwilling and possibly unable to reach accommodation with the Hutus, Burundi's Tutsis created ethnically pure areas in the country's main cities, particularly here in the capital. While a virtual Tutsi enclave, Bujumbura still allows Hutu workers and traders to come into the city during the day, although sometimes at the pain of beatings, robberies and even killings. Manirakiza's daily trip to his offices at an international relief organization is a trip of fear, which has now boiled down to a quiet acceptance of death, if and when it comes. ``The military burned all my property,'' he said. ``I have a lot of fear but I must come to work. I have no choice. I have to work to take care of my family.''\n",

      "There's a Dangerous Scent of Decay in a Troubled North Korea. The following editorial appeared in Friday's Los Angeles Times: All of North Korea Friday, according to its government-run press, was celebrating with delirious joy and heartfelt tributes the 54th birthday of its Great Leader, Kim Jong Il. The exuberance of the festivities, however, is shadowed by a passel of unpleasant facts the world's last Stalinist regime prefers not to advertise. For example, that official incompetence has exacerbated the food shortages caused by natural disasters, threatening hundreds of thousands of Kim's subjects with famine. Or that North Koreans in growing numbers are risking hellish imprisonment and even execution by trying to flee the country. Some have been able to make their way to South Korea, many more have crossed into China, some -- among the lucky few allowed to travel abroad -- have requested asylum farther afield. Among the latter is said to be Sung Hye Rim, Kim's castoff first wife and the mother of his eldest son and presumed dynastic heir. Embarrassments like these can take the fun out of any birthday party. Kim Jong Il himself, rarely seen and never heard, remains a mystery. July 8 will be the second anniversary of the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, the founder of the North Korean state. Since the elder Kim's death the North Korean press has spared no ink in trying to transfer to his successor the cult of personality built up for decades around the father. What hasn't been transferred yet, and no one is sure why, are the late Kim's key titles of state president and general secretary of the Workers' (Communist) Party. What this indicates is that Kim Jong Il is far from having the near-absolute influence wielded by his father. He has been confirmed as head of the military. That is his essential prop, but it has been obtained at a price. Some unusually candid recent comments from North Korean officials suggesting military opposition to soliciting food aid from abroad indicate that the military's influence on policy may now be stronger than ever. A country that has suffered three or four consecutive years of negative economic growth, that cannot feed its people and whose vast shortcomings are emphasized by the political and economic successes of the rival South Korea is a country whose leaders can only feel acute anxiety and fear. Some U.S. experts, reluctant in the past to forecast events in North Korea, are now talking about its potential for collapse within two or three years. What concerns American and South Korean officials is that as this possibility deepens, Pyongyang's leaders could be driven to take desperate measures to survive, the most dangerous of which would be a military attack on South Korea -- to whose armed defense the United States is committed. It's hard to see how a North Korea now largely denied the economic support it could once count on from Moscow and Beijing can turn around its rapidly declining fortunes. As in Eastern Europe in 1989, a process of political self-destruction may have begun, one that could imperil others as it unfolds. Kim Jong Il: Might his regime take some desperate action?\n",

      "Treading on the Downtrodden. The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times: To withhold promised and needed help to Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, may be politically advantageous for Jesse Helms and Bob Dole, but it is wrongheaded and destructive. Declaring the Clinton administration's Haiti policy a failure, the Republican-controlled Congress is tying up $13 million in already allocated aid on human rights grounds. Dole, the presumed GOP presidential nominee, contends the 2-month-old administration of Rene Preval has not met human rights standards required by U.S. law to receive the aid. The senator cites about 30 cases of political violence in Haiti over the last 17 months. Those figures, regrettably, are accurate. However, in the context of previous political violence in Haiti they indicate a drastic and welcome improvement. There were 3,000 deaths attributable to political violence in the three years of military rule before Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Preval's predecessor, was restored to power 17 months ago. Obviously, a justice system cannot be built in a matter on months.\n",

      "Measure to Raise Calif. Minimum Wage Ready for Ballot (Los Angeles). Setting up an intense political battle between advocates for the working poor and major business interests, a union-sponsored coalition apparently has gathered enough signatures to put an initiative on California's November ballot to sharply raise the state minimum wage. Even employer groups that oppose the proposition concede it is nearly certain to qualify for this fall's elections and has a strong chance of winning. The initiative, designed to tap rising anti-business sentiment and growing frustration over stagnant wages, would boost the state's hourly minimum wage in two steps from $4.25 currently to $5.75 by March 1998. The federal minimum wage, which establishes a national floor for workers' pay, also is $4.25 an hour, and efforts by the Clinton administration and its allies to increase the standard have languished. Although opponents of the California proposition still are formulating their arguments, the debate is expected to revolve around a basic question: Is raising the minimum wage an effective way of lifting families out of poverty?

      "Raising Minimum Wage Would Lessen Public Dependence on Handouts \n",
      " Kelly Candaele teaches labor economics at the Labor Center, Los \n",
      " Angeles Community College.. When President Clinton spoke in his State of the Union address about shrinking the underclass by raising the minimum wage, he made an explicit plea to Republicans and Democrats to embrace his proposal. ``You can't make a living on $4.25 an hour,'' he said, adding that we needed to ``make the minimum wage a living wage.'' His message was good public policy. But it was also good politics, a political volley designed to solidify part of a voter base largely animated by economic concerns. Clinton was also mindful of the grass-roots movement in California to raise the standard of living of our lowest wage earners. If Bob Dole wants to compete for part of that same pool of voters and not concede the economic high ground to Clinton, he should also endorse raising the minimum wage. By the time he reaches the Republican convention in San Diego, Dole should be a firm supporter of the Living Wage Initiative, which backers say has received enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot. The initiative would raise California's minimum wage to $5 an hour in 1997 and $5.75 in 1998. The usual suspects with usual arguments will fight raising the minimum wage. Small-business interests will cry that it would close them down. Academic economists will ``prove'' that more jobs will be lost than created. Conservative pundits will echo Pat Buchanan's claim that increasing the minimum wage will ``hurt the ones you are trying to help,'' namely entry-level minorities and unskilled workers who will be ``priced out'' of the job market. But when economists reach for their flow charts, voters should reach for their common sense. Historically, moderate increases in the minimum wage have not translated into job losses for young or unskilled adults. In the real world, low and moderate income groups spend any additional money that they earn. They prime the pump of our economy by investing in basic goods and services, not in rare stamps or fine wines. That means overall employment levels go up as the market responds. Beyond the strictly economic arguments however, society has an obligation to tell those who want to become entrepreneurs that if the only way to stay in business is to pay a poverty wage, then they simply shouldn't be in business. And make no mistake about it, the current minimum is a poverty wage. By U.S. Department of Health and Human Services standards, a family of three requires $12,980 a year to rise above the poverty level. A 40-hour week at the current California minimum of $4.25 generates $8,840 a year. There are 1.5 million California workers who earn less than $5 an hour and, contrary to popular belief, 80 percent are adults, not teen-agers.\n",

      "Hike in Minimum Wage: Plight of Working Poor Demands Action. The following editorial appeared in Monday's Los Angeles Times: The very poor in America generally don't hold jobs, and the working poor too often receive the most meager reward for their labors. At the current minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, full-time work for a year earns only about $8,800. If raised to $5.15 in the two 45-cent annual increments that most Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are ready to vote for, the federal minimum wage would provide an annual income of about $10,700. So the proposed hike, ensnared for weeks in partisan bickering, would provide no royal road out of poverty. But like all the other increases since 1938 when the Fair Labor Standards Act set the first minimum wage at 25 cents an hour, it would marginally improve the living standards of millions in the work force. Polls make clear that most Americans -- 80 percent and more in some surveys -- favor raising the minimum wage, in part as a reward for the work ethic. It's time for Congress to approve an increase in the hourly minimum, the first raise since 1991. Who works at minimum wages? The Labor Department estimates that, counting both hourly and piece-rate workers, 6.6 million members of the non-farm work force are paid the legal minimum. Add to that those earning less than $5.15 an hour, the proposed rate for 1997, and the number rises to 12 million. Many work in the restaurant, fast-food, apparel and hotel industries and in retail trade. The Labor Department counts 40 percent of these 12 million people as ``the sole breadwinners in their family,'' with 11 percent identified as the sole breadwinners in a family with children. In California, about 1.3 million workers are paid the minimum wage. As economists constantly remind us, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and the consequences of raising labor costs by increasing the minimum wage would be felt in two ways. Prices would rise somewhat as businesses passed on to consumers as much of their higher costs as market conditions allowed, and some jobs would probably be eliminated as employers tightened up to try to keep a lid on their payroll costs. How many jobs might be lost is, not surprisingly, a matter of sharp dispute. Estimates range from none up to 600,000. Some recent studies even argue that a higher minimum wage could increase employment. It's of course the least skilled who would be cut from the work force. However, several studies made after the last two minimum wage increases, in 1990 (to $3.80 an hour) and 1991 (to $4.25), found no significant effect on employment.\n",

      " International Committee of the Red Cross.. The International Committee of the Red Cross is at its wits' end because of Liberia's chaotic violence. For the fourth frightening time in that West African nation's six-year-old conflict, the Red Cross last month was left with no choice but to evacuate its foreign staff. We have evacuated staff from other African countries in the past, but never because of such uncontrolled banditry. This is the first time in our long African involvement that the Red Cross has determined that circumstances on the ground make it unrealistic to send back permanent expatriate staff. Why? Because we now unfortunately know the scenario by heart. Teenage fighters high on drink or drugs steal our vehicles. They then drive off to bring in reinforcements who follow suit, multiplying the looting and anarchy at the expense of the ordinary Liberians we seek to help. Stolen relief agency vehicles also serve Liberia's various warlords, always short of transportation. The bandits also prize aid workers' satellite telephones, ever handy to communicate with the world's media. And they especially covet our radio equipment for communicating with their troops in the field. Earlier in the decade, we frequently were accused of prolonging the violence in Somalia because at most 5 percent of the food we distributed was misappropriated by the warlords. But we would argue more than 1.5 million Somalis survived the famine as a result of our efforts. In Liberia, no rules are obeyed and thus no deals hold. We learned the hard way. As part of our credo of impartially dealing with all parties to conflicts, we were the first humanitarian organization to be in touch with all Liberia's warring factions and their leaders. For our efforts, we regularly were accused by each and every side of helping its adversaries. We took that as a confirmation of our independence. Meanwhile, we remain convinced that solidarity with the victims of the conflict in Liberia remains indispensable. But a genuine effort must be made to restore stability independently of humanitarian operations. Our hope was to have all aid agencies in Liberia strictly observe a code of security procedures in dealing with the warlords for the greater good of the civilians we all were trying to help. Unlike more pragmatic organizations unburdened by our scruples about neutrality, we never sought the armed protection of ECOMOG, the West African peacekeeping force, for our relief convoys.

Surrounded by congressmen, labor advocates and human rights workers, a 15-year-old Honduran girl Wednesday appealed to celebrity Kathie Lee Gifford to help end the abuse of children in sweatshops that make garments bearing Gifford's name. ``I want to talk to Kathie Lee to ask her to help us put an end to all this maltreatment,'' said Wendy Diaz, a former worker at a factory in her native Honduras that made Gifford's line of clothing for the Wal-Mart retail giant. She said she was among about 100 minors, some as young as 12 years old, who routinely worked 13 hours a day for 31 cents an hour and were subjected to threats, physical abuse and sexual harassment by the sweatshop's South Korean owners. The diminutive Honduran girl told her story at a Capitol Hill news conference aimed at promoting congressional efforts to hold retailers, manufacturers and celebrities more accountable for the labor practices behind the clothing that they produce and market. ``Parents have a right to know that the toys and clothes they buy for their children are not made by exploited children,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``The fact is, despite laws against the use of child labor and laws protecting the minimum wage, labor exploitation is rampant, both domestically and abroad.'' He called on U.S. companies voluntarily to adopt the use of a ``No Sweat'' label certifying that ``this product (was) not made with child or exploited labor.''

      " the Cato Institute in Washington.. Not so long ago, Central America dominated the headlines, and not always for the right reasons. Nonetheless, in many ways the Reagan-Bush approach to Central America has been vindicated. Nicaragua and El Salvador, which once teetered on the edge of a Cuba-like abyss, are now robust democracies. In Guatemala, refugees are returning to their homes under the watchful eye of a small army of American ``accompaniers.'' Sadly, the Clinton administration's policies are putting this progress at risk. With its sacrifices in the struggle against communism forgotten, Central America now finds itself superfluous to Washington. As aid to Central America dwindles toward zero, the United States is leading the charge to provide $5 billion for reconstruction in Bosnia. And, rather than being congratulated for its democratic progress, Central America is criticized for failing to achieve perfection in human rights. Most devastating of all, the administration's obsession with Mexico is stripping away the basis for rational economic planning in Central America. Many thoughtful Central Americans accept these developments philosophically. With the major war-related aid programs nearing completion, Miguel Salaverria, a former foreign minister of El Salvador, comments wryly that it ``is easier to find money for war than peace.'' He makes the point, however, that El Salvador and its neighbors are not looking for a handout. They simply want the opportunity to compete on level terms with Mexico. Unfortunately for Central America, the dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso over the past year makes fair competition impossible. In Central America, wages for entry-level workers at well-run businesses average 85 cents an hour. In the Mexican maquiladora plants, devaluation means wages of half that rate or less. On top of this, under NAFTA, Mexican goods receive tariff-free entry to the United States. The result is that Central American businesses find themselves uncompetitive. Potential foreign investors take one look at the region's figures and hurry on to Mexico, licking their lips at the prospect of abundant labor at less than 50 cents an hour.\n",

He added, however, that the problem was a priority for the White House and promised to work with the committee to address the issue. The bill would ban the import of products made by child labor; prohibit foreign aid other than humanitarian to countries that do not have child-labor laws or do not enforce them; and, prohibit loans from the United States to agencies that use child labor and direct U.S. representatives to the World Bank and other multilateral institutions to oppose the provision of funds to industries that use child labor.\n",

But after Mao died in 1976 and Deng came to power, Li became a convert to the economic reforms whose benefits he now hopes the rail line will help foster in Fuyang. ``This railroad is a big chance for us,'' he said during an interview at a local hotel. ``Never in history has so much attention been paid to Fuyang.''\n",

      "IMF, World Bank to Offer Debt Relief to Poor Nations. For decades, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have served as guardians of economic orthodoxy. They have insisted on strict fiscal controls when lending money to developing countries, requiring countries to balance their budgets and repay their debts in a timely manner. But some important changes in the old orthodoxy have been emerging from the fund and the bank over the past week at their annual meeting, which ends Thursday. For the first time, these advocates of tightfisted budgets are publicly exhorting Third World countries to make sure they spend enough in areas such as education and health that boost human development. And the governing bodies of the fund and the bank this week formally launched an initiative that they would have considered heretical a few years ago -- a plan to offer debt relief to 20 or so of the world's poorest countries. These shifts reflect a recognition that the traditional economic medicine prescribed by the two institutions needs to be reformulated. Critics have long complained that the fund and the bank exacerbate global poverty by insisting on debt repayment from countries that are hopelessly burdened by their obligations to creditors. Critics also blame IMF/World Bank ``structural adjustment'' policies for causing governments to cut the very programs -- such as spending for primary schools -- that might alleviate poverty and boost long-term development.\n",

      "U.N. Evacuates Relief Workers as Rebels Rout Zairean Army (Goma). Fearful of growing chaos and a widening war, the United Nations safely evacuated the last international aid workers from this embattled city Saturday after bands of rebel fighters backed by Rwandan government soldiers routed the Zairean army and captured the key border enclave. The fall of Goma, and the emergency withdrawal of about 130 terrified expatriates by road to nearby Rwanda, means that no U.N. or other foreign aid groups are able to assist more than 1 million ethnic Hutu refugees and displaced Zaireans scattered along a broad swath of eastern Zaire. Their fate is now in the hands of the defeated Zairean army, the largely powerless Zairean government, and ethnic Hutu refugee leaders and extremist militias, many of whom have been accused of masterminding the genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Aid workers warned that many of the disabled persons, elderly, children and others in vulnerable groups are at risk of perishing due to exposure or disease in the rugged mountains and volcanic fields, now drenched each afternoon with seasonal rains. ``There will be no assistance for the foreseeable future,'' Guy Avognon, the area coordinator for the U.N.

The Rwandan refugees who have trudged home in recent days -- a handful among the hundreds of thousands essentially lost in the hills of Zaire -- have returned with little more than shredded clothing, ravaged health and dark memories. They tell of slogging for days, sometimes weeks, to return to this small central African country after being driven out of refugee camps where they had lived for two years, around the Zairian town of Goma. They tell of being separated from children and spouses. And they describe seeing fellow refugees wander into the forest, some eventually falling dead of thirst and hunger. ``Most of the refugees did not get anything to eat or drink,'' said Raheri Nyirabarakagira, 44, who arrived in a transit camp for returning Rwandan refugees earlier this week. ``As I walked back, I saw many people dead because they did not have anything for eating.'' Such remembrances are among the sparse bits of information that governments and relief agencies have latched onto as they seek the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire with whom they have had no contact for a week. After evacuating Zaire last weekend during fierce fighting for control of Goma, aid workers have been unable to track the 400,000 refugees crowded into a single teeming camp or the hundreds of thousands more who were driven into the hills by the combat. Most of the refugees are members of Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority who fled in the aftermath of a campaign of genocide in 1994, when Hutus slaughtered at least 500,000 of the country's minority tribe, the Tutsis. Hutus poured into eastern Zaire fearing reprisals after a Tutsi-led rebel force halted the massacres and took control of Rwanda.\n",

The crowning achievement of a five-day World Trade Organization ministerial conference that ended here Friday was a highly detailed agreement to eliminate tariffs on most information technology products by 2000. But the most divisive and problematic issue at the 128-nation conference was workers' rights, a topic finally dealt with in an ambiguous paragraph that everyone knew would have to be completely devoid of any immediate practical meaning. Such immense energy went into drafting an almost irrelevant statement because the relationship between labor conditions and world trade is inherently in conflict -- and of huge importance to the future of the world's increasingly globalized economy. The key economic advantage poor countries bring to world trade, which enables them to compete at all with richer societies, is the low wages -- sometimes extremely low wages -- of most of their workers. Under such conditions, violations of internationally recognized ideals, such as the abuse of child labor, are not uncommon. Thus the debate here was simply the opening round within the world's premier trade organization of what is sure to be decades of argument. In the end, the vague agreement on worker rights enabled all sides -- from highly developed democracies to poverty-stricken dictatorships -- to claim at least modest victory.\n",

      "Clinton Urged to Limit Benefits for Workfare Participants (Washn). Putting the White House in a difficult political bind, a coalition of state and local human services agencies Wednesday urged the Clinton administration to waive provisions of the Fair Labor Standards act -- including the minimum wage -- for welfare recipients placed in community service jobs. A resolution passed Wednesday by the American Public Welfare Association marks a significant escalation of pressure on the administration to rule on a central question of welfare reform. Requiring states to pay ``workfare'' participants the minimum wage of $5.15 per hour (beginning Sept. 1, 1997) and comply with other provisions of the labor act, such as overtime pay, could undermine their ability to administer welfare programs more efficiently than the federal government, the agencies contend. Labor groups and advocates for the poor, however, are pressing Clinton equally hard to ensure that the labor act applies to welfare recipients required to work in community service jobs as a condition of receiving public aid. The position the White House ultimately takes is expected to have enormous financial implications, since hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients who cannot be placed in private-sector jobs are likely to wind up on the rolls of state workfare programs. State administrators fear that branding welfare recipients who are fulfilling work requirements as workers could have far-reaching consequences. It could possibly make them eligible for a wide range of costly employee benefits, including unemployment insurance, workers compensation and even paid vacation and sick days.\n",

      "Zaire) By John Daniszewski. In an ominous development threatening more than 100,000 Hutu refugees facing starvation and disease in eastern Zaire, rebel alliance officials Friday blocked the United Nations from starting an airlift to carry them back to Rwanda. The refugees have been on the run since 1994 and are on their last legs, dying at a rate of about 60 a day. Officials of UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, believe it is imperative for the airlift to go ahead. But rebel authorities who now control the major eastern city of Kisangani refused permission, saying that if refugees are brought into town to reach the only available airport, they will spread deadly cholera to the population. Rebel radio stations, meanwhile, have been broadcasting incendiary reports, whipping up anti-refugee feelings that contributed to riots Friday against the refugees and the aid workers trying to help them. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler, speaking from Nairobi, emphasized that there have been no cases of cholera in the Biaro camp, 25 miles south of Kisangani, from which the first group of 80 refugee children was to be airlifted. The cholera that has been detected in another camp is a mild strain and could be easily controlled, he added.\n",

      "Program Aims to Expand Saving in Poor Communities. For years, a small group of academics and community activists has been searching for solutions to one of the most vexing problems facing the nation's poor: a lack of savings that would help them escape poverty by buying homes, starting businesses or paying for college. Now, a relatively simple idea known as ``individual development accounts,'' in which a community organization deposits a dollar or more for every dollar saved by an eligible family, is quickly gaining popularity across the country. Congress endorsed the concept in the welfare law enacted last year. Nearly two dozen states are setting up such programs or seriously considering them. And Thursday, the idea got a significant boost when the Ford Foundation pledged $15 million to expand and study savings account programs in America's poor communities. ``Most people get ahead by having assets to help them out in times of trouble, or when they plan for their children's education, or when they try to achieve some social mobility,'' said Melvin Oliver, a Ford Foundation vice president and former director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty. ``One thing poor people don't have is that kind of asset.'' Proponents of the individual development accounts, or IDAs, argue that they not only help families pay for otherwise unattainable dreams, but serve to revitalize low-income communities by promoting local businesses and home ownership.\n",

      "Feeding the Starving Masses Doesn't Make for a Coherent Policy \n",
      " Manning was a State Department adviser for Asia policy \n",
      " from 1989-93. He recently returned from a visit to Korea.. ``One of the biggest humanitarian disasters in our lifetime'' is how U.N. World Food Program Director Catherine Bertini assesses the situation in North Korea. Even allowing for unknowable details, tens of thousands of North Koreans face famine in the coming months. Mass starvation, however, is the starkest symptom of a larger problem: a failing totalitarian state whose military remains a serious threat to South Korea as well as to 37,000 American soldiers stationed there. Unfortunately, U.S. policy still lacks the coherence to meet this important challenge. North Korea's continuing food crisis sorely tests America's noble humanitarian tradition. Its food problem is not a one-time emergency, aswas the case in Somalia and Sudan. Floods certainly triggered the country's food shortages, but four decades of agriculture mismanagement is the underlying cause. Any short-term aid will not alter the long-term outlook, an estimated shortfall of 1.8 million tons annually for the next several years. Even if its distribution is meticulously monitored, moreover, food given to starving North Koreans allows domestic production to feed its armed forces, which shows no signs of undernourishment. Pyongyang also spends millions on shrines and birthday celebrations for its leaders; 25 percent of the country's gross domestic product goes to the military, which recently celebrated its 65th anniversary in a lavish goose-stepping performance in front of CNN cameras. And its leaders exhibit a prickly attitude toward donors, as Vietnam found out last week when they rejected its offer of food. In such circumstances, the moral response of humanitarian food aid may only entrench the powers that created the disaster in the first place, keeping the Korean Peninsula a dangerous flash point, with the potential for either a military confrontation or implosion of North Korea. Either development dramatically would alter the balance of power in northeast Asia and affect U.S. interests. One would think that given the stakes involved and the persisting turmoil, Korea would be high on the priority lists of top U.S. policy-makers. Certainly, the Korean agenda occupies scores of bureaucrats. But the worker bees operate in a vacuum. Astonishing as it may seem, six months after the presidential election, an Asia foreign-policy team is not in place: Neither an assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific nor ambassadors for South Korea and Japan have been nominated.\n",

      "A White House Visit. The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: With 193 million people, Indonesia is the fourth-most populous nation in the world. Its rapid development during the past two decades has moved most Indonesians out of abject poverty, and now many of them want more political freedom. How the regime responds to those aspirations will affect U.S. political and economic interests in a vital area of the world. President Suharto, who has ruled the Indonesian archipelago for an astonishing three decades-plus, staged one of his regular election exercises last month. The intention was to show his people, and the world, that at the age of 76 he remains firmly in command. The effect was quite the opposite; the world saw that the president is increasingly out of touch with his prospering, multiethnic nation. The regime's repression of any credible opposition led to violent outbreaks in many parts of the country. His refusal to establish a process for orderly succession, to deal with growing corruption among his relatives and cronies or to provide any space for civil society can only cause anxiety about Indonesia's future. Nowhere is the cause for concern greater than in East Timor, a distant island that has been resisting Indonesian colonization for more than 20 years. Indonesia seized East Timor with a war that cost the lives of perhaps one-third of the Timorese population, originally only 800,000 or so. Since then a brutal military occupation has only hardened resistance. Much like the Chinese in Tibet, Indonesia has used settlement as a political tactic, promoting the migration of Javanese to East Timor to overwhelm and subjugate the native population. During the election, Timorese frustration at being denied the right to a referendum on their status boiled over, leading to clashes that took at least 37 lives. Since then, Indonesian forces have stepped up their arrests and torture. President Clinton met in the White House the other day with Bishop Carlos Belo, who last fall won the Nobel Peace Prize for unflinching devotion to his countrymen and their nonviolent struggle. Without advocating any particular political solution, the bishop has said the Timorese people must be consulted about their island's future. He urged Mr. Clinton to press Indonesia's leaders to respect human rights in East Timor. They have promised to do so before, but -- as the U.N. Human Rights Commission noted in April -- their record is one of ``extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention.'' It's a record that serves Indonesia poorly, at home and abroad.\n",

      "Inching Toward Talks. The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: Next week North Korea marks the third anniversary of the death of its ``Great Leader,'' Stalinist dictator Kim Il-sung. Will his son, ``Dear Leader'' Kim Jong-il, now move to consolidate publicly his ruling position, as many Korea scholars predict? Perhaps no one but the erratic Mr. Kim himself can say for sure-just as no outsiders can confidently assess his grip on power, or the extent of famine inside his closed nation or whether food shortages are weakening its system of iron social and political control. North Korea remains, in other words, as much as ever an enigma -- as well as a potential source of conflict. One of the world's poorest countries, North Korea nonetheless maintains one of the world's largest armies, which may still harbor a desire to reunify Korea by force. U.S. troops guard South Korea's border, a guarantee that America would be involved in any conflict. More than 40 years after the Korean War ended, the border remains one of the world's most perilous locations. The Clinton administration, wrestling with these twin elements of mystery and danger, has patiently sought to entice North Korea into four-party negotiations, along with China and South Korea. The long-term goal would be to reach a permanent peace on the peninsula, one that might pave the way for eventual, peaceful reunification between the two, very different Koreas-that is, to finally end the war. In the short term, the talks could promote confidence-building measures on the border, open new avenues for trade and communication and, simply by their existence, bolster stability. President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam first proposed such talks in April 1996. Last week North Korea took a significant step toward joining them, promising to show up for an Aug. 5 meeting that will discuss when -- not whether -- the actual talks will begin. North Korea's dire food shortage may well have brought the regime far enough out of its isolation to take this step. The United States has made clear that food aid will not be used as a bargaining chip to get North Korea to the table. Rather, it will be provided based on need and to the extent it can be monitored to ensure, for example, that it is not used to feed soldiers. North Korea's leaders may have realized that their chances of attracting substantial humanitarian aid increase as they reduce tensions and share information about their country.\n",

      "Why Privatization Won't Work in China \n",
      " Dujarric is a research fellow in the national security studies \n",
      " department at the Hudson Institute's Washington office.. As the just-concluded 15th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party shows, Chinese leaders are keen to sell off state-owned enterprises, though to avoid losing face they prefer euphemisms like ``public ownership'' to ``privatization.'' Regardless of the decisions taken at the congress, however, the reforms will almost certainly fail to bring modern capitalism to China. First, private property is a simple concept but one that requires detailed and well-enforced laws to work well. Communist nations, where the state owns everything, can do without tax regulations, contract law, civil courts, commercial codes and competent judges, but market economies cannot. Without these institutions, which Americans take for granted, societies are doomed to anarchy (at worse) or to poverty (at best). The legal and enforcement mechanisms needed to manage a capitalist system are complex and take many decades to develop. China lacks this legal and institutional infrastructure. Its leaders are against the rule of law and there is an enormous shortage of personnel who understand the legal and institutional foundations of capitalism. Because China has never experienced modern capitalism, it is wishful thinking to expect that government reforms can rapidly establish a well-functioning market economy. Second, privatization in China is likely to become ``nomenklatura privatization,'' i.e., the transfer of assets to powerful industrial managers and political figures. These individuals will manage the ``privatized'' firms in their interest rather than accept the need to serve outside investors. (I once heard a Central Asian official proudly say that he had privatized a local hotel. He meant that he now owned it.) Therefore, as has happened in several post-communist states, privatization will fail to institute one of the key elements of capitalism, namely the power of shareholders to control and fire managers and to sell their holdings to whomever they want. A related aspect of this problem is that Chinese privatization will provide ample opportunities for bureaucrats, party officials and their families to enrich themselves by taking over state property at no cost. Using their political connections, they are likely to get the government to grant their businesses monopolies and subsidies, thus hurting the economy and consumers. This will make the masses think that capitalism is nothing but a get-rich scheme for the elite and will fuel resentment.\n",

      "Albright Emphasizes Africa in U.N. Meeting (United Nations). Asserting that ``it is high time that more attention be paid to a continent very important to all of us,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright Thursday presided over a special ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council to explore how the United Nations can help Africa win its struggles against poverty and genocidal civil strife. The meeting of the 15-nation council heard about the need for the international community to support what Albright, the chairman, called ``long-delayed aspirations for freedom, growing prosperity and simple human dignity.'' But beneath the generalities, there were strong hints that the African nations and the countries of the developed world have differing views about how best to meet the continent's needs. The Africans clearly were concerned that pressures for reforming the United Nations will mean substantial cutbacks of the development aid that they regard as the world body's most important function. Ministers from industrial countries, while sympathetic, said aid resources are limited and urged the Africans to do more to help themselves. In regard to some specific problems such as Libyan terrorism and human rights abuses in Congo, the divergences appeared especially sharp. Albright, who announced that she will visit Africa later this year, gave a generally bright assessment, saying that democracy and economic growth are on the rise in many parts of the continent. She said the Clinton administration will continue to provide aid, which last year totaled $2.5 billion for sub-Sahara Africa and, through the use of Peace Corps volunteers and other agencies, will promote ``democracy-building programs'' to develop parliaments, independent judiciaries and a free press. However, a more mixed message about the continent's future was delivered by Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, who also is chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Like many other African states, his country operates under restricted political freedoms and tight central controls over the economy.\n",

      "N. Korean Concession in Food Aid Monitoring Could Be Significant. The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times: The State Department confirms that several cans of donated American food were found aboard a North Korean submarine that ran aground off South Korea last fall, adding credibility to suspicions that at least some relief supplies meant for famine-stricken civilians have gone instead to the military. That makes expansion of international monitoring of famine aid even more essential, to try to assure that food reaches those most desperately in need rather than the relatively well-cared-for military. Aware that further aid could be contingent on allaying donors' doubts, Pyongyang says it will let 10 more relief monitors join the seven already in the country. Moreover, in an unprecedented step, it will soon admit a seven-member team of U.S. experts to assess how food is being distributed. How freely these observers are able to move about could provide an important clue to how serious North Korea might be in wanting better relations with the world outside. Even a carefully chaperoned visit should provide insights into a society under sentence of starvation on a wide scale and sliding steadily toward economic collapse. A Washington Post reporter who was able to accompany a visiting congressman on a brief trip to North Korea last week describes fearsome scenes of dying teen-agers with the body sizes of 6-year-olds, of surgery performed without anesthetics in cold, reeking, dark hospitals, of the lights in the showcase capital of Pyongyang going out every evening because the power plants lacked fuel. This is not likely to be a passing crisis. Drought, floods and soil erosion have laid waste to the countryside. No less destructive have been the decades of Stalinist controls that have retarded opportunities for development and growth. That the world's most reclusive state is now, even in a small way, opening itself to scrutiny is a clear sign of how desperate its plight has become. For what outside observers are seeing is not just the results of nature's ravages but the consequences of a mindless and failed system that, like so many of North Korea's pitiful citizens, seems to be slowly, painfully, inexorably dying.\n",

Preparing for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's recent visit to Haiti, U.S. Embassy aides selected as one of her prospective stops a giant flour mill, a site that struck them as the perfect symbol of what this Caribbean country must do in its arduous march toward economic well-being. The mill, now controlled by a consortium of American and other private investors, is the first public enterprise sold by the Haitian government under its new privatization program. A visit by Albright would underscore the importance of privatization and foreign investment. But when the advance staff reached the mill, they were in for a surprise: Occupying it were angry former workers demanding more severance pay. The Embassy hurriedly canceled the planned Albright stop. The incident reflects the nettlesome, enervating problems involved in trying to bolster the economy of Haiti, which for decades has been the poorest and sickliest nation in the Western Hemisphere. So far, the end of military rule and the return of democracy under the protection of more than 20,000 U.S. troops three years ago have done little to turn its moribund economy around.

Opening a two-day meeting of senior counternarcotics officials here that will free up tens of millions of dollars in European and U.S. anti-drug aid for this region, the officials also acknowledged that powerful drug organizations increasingly are using this area's booming off-shore industry to launder billions of dollars in illicit profits.

The United Nations -- releasing new statistics that show 40 percent of the cocaine sold in America alone now enters via the Caribbean, a figure 10 percent higher than previous estimates -- confirmed that Colombian cocaine producers are forging new partnerships in the region.

Third, they will mostly still be poorer than today's developed countries, and less able to bear or to mitigate any hardship that climate change may bring. Meanwhile, representatives of the developed countries act as if major developing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil ought to do something about greenhouse emissions on their own, and can somehow be induced to do so. But the developing countries, notwithstanding their vulnerability to climate change, have at least three reasons for locating their priorities elsewhere. Most of them have terrible immediate environmental problems: They need sanitation, safe drinking water, safe air, vaccination, health education and public-health infrastructure against vector-borne diseases. Their best defense against potential climate change is their own development -- continued reduction in their dependence on agriculture, improved nutrition and environmental protection against disease. And most of them can expect their descendants to be immensely better off materially than they themselves: To divert their own resources to make their great grandchildren better off will seem to be redistributing income in the wrong direction. Any substantial effort, in the next couple of decades, to reduce greenhouse emissions will have to be at the expense of the developed nations and, mainly, for the benefit of the developing nations. Intended or not, it will largely be a foreign aid program. Slowing Chinese carbon dioxide emissions will eventually be critical; who will be willing to pay for it will also be critical.\n",

      "Rescue Workers Trek to Site of Afghan Quake \n",
      " (Islamabad, Pakistan). Teams of aid workers began making their way Saturday toward villages in northern Afghanistan devastated by an earthquake as uncertainty continued about the death toll, which the International Committee of the Red Cross tentatively estimated at about 2,150. The first tremor struck an impoverished, mountainous farming area in Takhar Province near the Afghan border with Tajikistan about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, but the first reports of what could be Afghanistan's deadliest natural disaster in decades did not filter out until 48 hours later because the country lacks international telephone service. The quake measured 6.1 on the Richter scale. The precarious construction of mud-and-brick homes built on hillsides contributed to the death and damage caused by what was not an extraordinarily powerful earthquake. Masood Khalili, Afghanistan's ambassador to India, said that the entire village of Khunj apparently slid down a mountainside, killing 1,600 in what he described as the settlement most seriously affected. Khalili remains loyal to ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani, and Takhar Province is in the one-third of Afghanistan not controlled by the Taliban Islamic militia, which drove Rabbani from the capital, Kabul in September 1996.\n",

      "Senate Panel Hears Testimony on Deceptive Loan Practices (Washn). A former employee of a lending company on Monday gave a Senate panel a detailed account of how he lured non-English speakers, racial minorities and the elderly into signing away their homes by taking on big loans that promised low monthly payments. Testifying anonymously from behind a shield to members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, the man helped lawmakers drive home a point: that Americans with low incomes and high equity on their homes need to beware of lending companies that offer attractive loan packages to consolidate bills, improve or refinance homes. Because many of the lending practices technically are legal, Monday's hearing aimed to educate the public -- especially those deemed most vulnerable -- how to avoid being victimized. The lesson: ``Ask lots of questions and don't sign anything until you're satisfied with all the answers to your questions,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the committee. Senators, legal aid attorneys, victims and the anonymous witness who committee members nicknamed ``Jim Dough'' described how some lending companies -- termed ``equity predators'' -- wage full-blown mail, telephone and door-to-door campaigns to find customers who are equity rich and cash poor. Home equity is the market value of a property minus the outstanding balance of the mortgage.\n",

      "Clinton's Guilt Trip (Washn). The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON -- Bill Clinton, by his excursions into national contrition on his current swing through Africa, raised eyebrows on two continents. He expressed regrets for slavery, for the Cold War coddling of some African dictators and for what he calls the country's slowness to respond to genocide in Rwanda. These subjects lie outside traditional diplomacy. His words expose him to the charge that for personal and political reasons he is advertising a lopsided and gratuitous vision of the country he represents. Still, he is addressing themes deeply relevant to the United States and Africa. Formative developments such as slavery and the Cold War, the continuing African mass upheavals: These are on American minds and on African minds as well. Most Washington talk of foreign affairs goes to matters of policy. The current, quiet policy argument centers on whether the administration has tilted too much toward development and stability as against democracy and human rights. It is necessary to remember, after all, that much African misery is the handiwork of tyrannical post-colonial African governments that were brutal to their own people and ransacked their own treasuries. To pretend otherwise or to maintain that all this was strictly a consequence of American support for a few truly crummy African leaders is condescending. Rwanda's bloody warfare was only one example of a persisting chaos. The quest for an understanding of these things should not slacken. Clinton identified American neglect as ``the biggest mistake America ever made with Africa over the long run.'' His trip was designed to counter that neglect. An admission of neglect carries an implicit promise to pay closer attention. The president, who early in his trip hailed a prospective African ``renaissance,'' has not offered new ideas to match. But some old ideas -- not just aid but trade and investment -- are still good. Support for Africa's institutional and physical infrastructures should proceed as fast as Africa's own participation permits. The Clinton concern for genocide should translate swiftly into international programs to spare new victims and rescue Africa's millions of refugees.\n",

      "N. Korea Erects Obstacles to Famine Relief. Aid officials are expressing increasing concern over widening food shortages and hunger in the isolated Stalinist state of North Korea. But despite the reports, the hard-line Communist government has continued to haggle with two of its biggest food donors, the United States and South Korea, over the monitoring of food shipments by international aid workers. ``The situation is getting worse and worse among the general population,'' said Doug Coutts, head of the World Food Program in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, in a telephone interview. Although Coutts said he believes North Korea is ``not in a famine situation yet,'' he said mortality rates have risen sharply as many people, weak from being underfed, die of diseases they might otherwise have survived. Other groups, including the Washington-based evangelical Christian charity World Vision, suggested that large numbers of people are dying. The South Korea-based Buddhist Sharing Movement surveyed 472 North Korean ``food refugees'' late last year and early this year in China and estimated that between 24 percent and 32 percent of their immediate family members had died as a result of a shortage of food. Most succumbed to disease, the movement's report said, adding that the refugees came from a wide range of North Korean cities. The World Food Program reported in March that North Korea's grain stocks will be near depletion by late this month or early May. Events in North Korea are affected by the government's unpredictability and the tense relationship with South Korea. More than 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed near South Korea's border with the North to protect the democratic South.\n",

Kosovo descended further Tuesday into a level of violence that many Western governments have long feared could trigger a greater Balkan war. According to reports from various sources, heavily armed Serb military and police units under the control of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic cut a swath of destruction in Decani and 10 surrounding villages, home to 65,000 mostly ethnic Albanians in a region southwest of Pristina, near the Albanian border. The units were apparently in the midst of a campaign to quash a rebel separatist movement in the once autonomous province that is part of Serbia and where the population is still 90 percent Albanian. Diplomats in the region were alarmed by reports from a human rights worker in the Decani area who said that Serb units shelled homes, let the people leave, and then set fire to the emptied buildings using flame throwers in one phase of the operation that began at 7 p.m. Monday and ended at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Serbian authorities closed the area to aid workers, outside observers and the media. Reporters who tried to reach the area were stopped by armed Serb policemen less than three miles from Pristina and ordered to return to the provincial capital.\n",

Solzhenitsyn's latest musings on the moral decline of Russia went on sale Thursday to the delight of a diminished intelligentsia, but widespread indifference among the more materialistic movers and shakers of the New Russia. ``Russia in Collapse,'' a 204-page condemnation of the society built on the ruins of Communism, waxes unabashedly critical on every aspect of modern life, from this country's fall from nuclear superpower status to its shocking mortality statistics to the poverty Solzhenitsyn contends the newly rich capitalists have imposed on 98 percent of the people. ``All the modern world is looking at us in amazement: How could such a huge Russia all of a sudden become so weak, lose much of its spirit and body, and dash headlong into self-destruction, having suffered no military defeat, revolution or civil war, not famine, neither epidemics nor natural disasters?'' asks the author, who was hospitalized a year ago and now spends most of his time in seclusion at a country dacha outside Moscow. Only 5,000 copies of ``Russia in Collapse'' were printed for initial release, the most telling sign that the doom-filled preaching of the 79-year-old writer hold little sway in a society already aware of its problems and ill-disposed toward wallowing in the hardship. Release of the bleak forecasts and judgments, the author's second volume of social commentary since his return in 1994 from 20 years in exile, came on a sun-splashed day when those prospering in the post-Soviet era were even less inclined than usual to be lectured by a writer who views their lives as corrupt and misguided.\n",

      "U.S. Policy Has Gone South. Is the Bush administration willing to support the struggle for survival of hundreds of millions of poor agricultural workers in nations unable to export their products to the rich countries of Europe and North America? We'll soon find out. The World Trade Organization ministerial conference opened Wednesday in Cancun, Mexico. U.S. foreign policy in Latin America has been a disaster. Few can trust the good intentions of the United States toward the hemisphere under a State Department immersed in hypocrisy: proclaiming free trade while imposing labor and environmental standards that extinguish the competitive advantages of small nations. Unions and big business -- in such industries as textiles and steel -- seem to be running foreign policy south of the border. And the GOP's call for ``trade rather than aid'' sounds hollow when trade does not include agriculture in a backward, agricultural hemisphere. Politicians consider sugar and Florida votes more important than hunger in Central America. Despite environmentalist propaganda, the world is a better place today than ever because hard-working people are producing more food, living longer and producing and trading more goods. But the increasingly high cost of senseless legislation, regulations, subsidies and protectionism is impeding progress. For poor nations, such laws mean hunger, illness and misery. The United States would not have prospered in the 19th and 20th centuries had it been subject to the trade conditions now imposed on the developing world. This is what the participants in Cancun can work toward changing.\n",

      "Afghan Aid Agencies Alarmed by Killings (Kabul, Afghanistan). The killing of four Afghan aid workers, who were ambushed, tied together and shot on their way back Monday from installing water pumps in a village in southeastern Afghanistan, has sent a sobering chill through the international aid network here and is likely to lead to a further scaling back of assistance projects in desperately poor rural areas. A fifth worker, who survived with bullet wounds to his legs, said the attackers had deliberately targeted the aid team -- which was traveling through Ghazni province in a clearly marked vehicle -- to send a warning to foreign charity work in Afghanistan. ``We've been working in this country for 18 years. We carried on through the civil war and the Taliban period, and we always had more freedom to operate than we do now,'' said Gorm Pedersen, director of the Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees (DACAAR), which employed the five men. ``We were always seen as neutral partners in development. Now we are targets.'' Pedersen and other officials said they believe that at least two of the nine assailants, who were riding motorbikes, were members of the Taliban, the extremist Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. The officials said the other assailants may have been local recruits of a rapidly re-emerging, Taliban-led guerrilla force that has sprung up across southern Afghanistan in the past several months. The attack was the deadliest in a series of sporadic but gradually escalating assaults against aid projects and employees since last spring -- including the shooting of a delegate from the International Committee of the Red Cross in March and several deadly attacks on Afghan mine clearance workers in May.\n",

      "Overlooking Hard Workers. Americans celebrate hard work. We love rags-to-riches stories. We tell welfare recipients that they must get off the rolls in five years because work builds character. But we have a blind spot: the millions of women and men who work for low wages, many in the growing service sector. The harried middle class relies on them to care for their children, cook their restaurant meals and attend to their elderly parents. Corporations hire them to park cars, sort mail, move office furniture and mop floors. They don't make much money -- the earnings of people without a college education haven't increased much since the 1970s. Yet the events of the past year suggest that middle-class and affluent Americans are overlooking and even demeaning them. More and more, their needs are losing out to the government's focus on reducing the welfare rolls and subsidizing the middle class. Consider workers whose annual incomes are between $10,000 and $20,000. One-fifth of all people who worked in 2001 fell into this category. Some are poor; some are perched precariously above the poverty line (which was $18,244 for a family of two adults and two children in 2002), and some are in families that pool their earnings to attain a working-class, or even lower-middle-class, lifestyle. More than half are women, and more than a third are nonwhite. As they try to follow the American work ethic, here are some of the obstacles they face. -- The health insurance squeeze: Virtually all welfare recipients receive health insurance coverage through Medicaid, the government program of medical assistance to the poor. The majority of middle-class workers receive health insurance through their, or their spouse's, employers. Low-wage workers, however, often fall between the cracks. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, one-third of full-time workers earning $10,000 to $20,000 had no health coverage in 2001; others undoubtedly had coverage for only part of the year. The crisis in state budgets is making this situation even worse. The Kaiser Commission reported that 17 states were planning to increase the co-payment low-income families must contribute to obtain Medicaid coverage in 2003. State officials are planning to increase co-payments or freeze enrollments in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. These increases may seem modest to the middle class but for low-income families they can be substantial. If the electric bill is overdue, hard-pressed parents may pay it rather than the co-payment and gamble that no one will get seriously ill. Unfortunately, some will lose this gamble.\n",

The aisles of the newly expanded Chelsea Market are a colorful barometer of the consumer craze that is sweeping Kabul, a poor but fast-growing capital of 2.5 million that is awash in foreign aid, international visitors and a steadily growing number of affluent returned refugees. The shelves are crammed with imported items not seen here in years, if ever: microwave popcorn and ``Miaow Mix,'' cling wrap and Clorox, Gillette razors and Grey Poupon mustard. Recently the owner, Assad Chelsi, has been experimenting with luxury items such as French cosmetics and fountain pens, and he soon plans to add a pharmacy upstairs. ``If you don't see it in the store today, I can get it for you tomorrow,'' Chelsi, 37, promises with the confident cheer of a born entrepreneur. He has circles under his eyes, but only from working around the clock to keep up with demand. ``During the Taliban time, I had about 200 customers a day. Now I can't even count, maybe 2,000. People are free now, and everything has changed.'' The view from Chelsi's corner of Kabul, a busy shopping area full of neon-flashing eateries and Internet cafes, might seem to support such buoyant hyperbole. Along the surrounding streets, there is more evidence of a spending surge: dozens of showy new or half-built houses with elaborate pillars, intricate tile designs and rooftop satellite dishes. But just beneath the glitter lies an economy urgently in need of industrial and commercial development. Nearly two years after the collapse of extremist Islamic rule under the Taliban and the establishment of a pro-Western, U.N.-backed government, most of the Afghan economy is still a rudimentary sidewalk bazaar, propped up by foreign assistance and a burgeoning opium poppy trade.\n",

This editorial appeared in today's Los Angeles Times: President Bush's plea to international aid groups to keep working in Iraq despite attacks against them was unfortunate. His poorly phrased remarks last month seemed to make the independent, civilian good Samaritans from a host of countries appendages of the U.S.-led army of invaders and occupiers. In the eyes of guerrillas, that makes them bigger targets. In April, Care International drafted guidelines, later adopted by other groups, insisting that aid organizations be allowed to operate free of military control in Iraq. The groups recognize the need to walk a fine line between, on the one hand, accepting the security that soldiers can provide for their staffs and, on the other, showing Iraqis they are independent of the U.S. government and provide help impartially. After a series of attacks on U.N. and Red Cross workers prompted staffing cuts in Iraq, Bush said that if nongovernmental organizations failed to return to Baghdad, ``they're doing exactly what the terrorists want them to do.'' That's true: Terrorists want chaos that forces foreign aid groups to cease operations. But U.S. officials must recognize that aid workers are not part of the government, and humanitarian missions are different from military campaigns. That lesson should have been learned through the strong objections of nongovernmental organizations to Secretary of State Colin L.

The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post: Despite continuing violence from a regrouped Taliban, there has been a stream of modest good news from Afghanistan this month. A major reconstruction project, the 300-mile highway from Kabul to Kandahar, was completed as U.S. aid officials prepared to pour an additional $2 billion into development projects next year. The first steps were taken to disarm the private armies of warlords who rule over large parts of the countryside, and U.S. and NATO commanders announced plans to establish small military posts, or ``provincial reconstruction teams,'' in a dozen places. The International Monetary Fund reported that the Afghan economy grew by 30 percent in 2002-03 and is likely to expand by another 20 percent next year. Most strikingly, some 500 delegates to an Afghan political convention, or loya jirga@, including more than 100 women, have spent the past 10 days peacefully debating the draft of a new constitution that would make Afghanistan an electoral democracy for the first time in its history. Thanks to some behind-the-scenes brokering, it now seems probable that the assembly will approve, largely unchanged, a draft that will create a strong presidential system of government -- one seemingly designed to perpetuate the influence of the moderate interim president, Hamid Karzai. So far, the objections of dissenters have been overruled: not just women seeking greater recognition of their rights, but ethnic and regional warlords who want a more decentralized system, and Islamic fundamentalists who want to mandate rule by religious law. The end result will almost certainly be unsatisfactory to advocates of liberal democracy and human rights. But it could give Afghans a chance to hold a legitimate democratic election for president sometime next year -- an extraordinary advance for a country that little more than two years ago was subject to the Taliban's primitive despotism. Liberal objections to the constitutional draft begin with its concentration of power in the hands of the president, who will be able to legislate by decree and probably will appoint provincial governors. There will be a two-chamber assembly, with designated places for women, but no prime minister who might emerge as an alternative source of authority. One concern is that this system could give excessive power to one ethnic group, such as Mr. Karzai's Pashtun. But most Afghans seem more worried about the opposing risk that decentralization could revive the factionalism and, eventually, civil war that destroyed the country in the early 1990s. The draft constitution commits Afghanistan to abide by the U.N. Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But women at the conference object to its omission of specific language granting women and men equal rights. Other experts point out that while the constitution's references to Islam are relatively mild -- sharia@, or Islamic law, is not mentioned -- clauses prohibiting laws or political parties opposed to Islam could be used by conservative judges to limit democracy or squelch religious reform movements.\n",

In 1990, Iran's mullahs bridled at international offers of aid after an earthquake hit the nation's northwest and killed as many as 50,000 people. Today, under moderate President Mohammad Khatami's leadership, Tehran has sped assistance to the ancient city of Bam, where tens of thousands reportedly perished in and after an earthquake Friday. Khatami quickly appealed for help, acknowledging that the first 48 hours were the most critical. Iran welcomed U.S. relief planes; its major vestige of the past came in ruling out help from Israel. Extraordinary local and international efforts averted a potentially worse tragedy, though the dangers of disease and exposure are far from over and distraught residents protest bitterly that Iran's government has done too little. Iranian volunteers have been burying the dead in mass graves to forestall the spread of diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria and dysentery. In a race against time, rescue workers have abandoned the Islamic custom of washing corpses before burial. Grieving families, understanding the peril, seem mostly to have agreed without complaint. Iranians have been donating blood, blankets and clothes, supplies that will get to the quake zone much faster than international donations of goods. With large numbers homeless, the danger from cold weather is acute. Aid has poured in swiftly from outside as well, because Iran wisely waived visa considerations. Japan, Germany and the United States, among other nations, are supplying assistance. The Pentagon is delivering more than 150,000 pounds of medical supplies from Kuwait, largely being distributed by the United Nations.\n",

      "Haitian Celebration Turns Violent (Port-au-Prince). Haitians marked their bicentennial of independence Thursday with passionate displays of pride, violence and vitriol to commemorate the bloody slave revolt that created the world's first black republic. Tens of thousands filled the streets of this deeply troubled capital in rival expressions of joy over the 200-year-old feat of abolishing slavery and anger at the persistent restraints on their liberty and living standards today. At a morning ceremony on the lawn of the National Palace, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide vowed to a crowd of about 15,000 supporters to lift his nation out of the abject poverty and despair prevailing a decade after a U.S. invasion restored him to power. Three hours later, throngs of government opponents crashed through police roadblocks in a march that quickly escalated into a melee. Police dispersed one group of about 5,000 by firing into the crowd, wounding six people and angering what had begun as a peaceful protest. Throughout the afternoon, the anti-Aristide crowd swelled to about 20,000, setting fire to piles of tires, choking the crumbling streets with thick black smoke and pelting police with rocks and bottles. Bursts of police gunfire and screaming sirens put an abrupt end to the air of celebration that had prevailed earlier. Most of the unrest played out in the capital as Aristide flew to the volatile city of Gonaives to deliver a speech at the site of Haiti's Jan. 1, 1804, proclamation of independence. Repeatedly delayed by reports of unrest in the city, the visit was curtailed after gunshots rang out from among crowds of demonstrators. State-controlled television failed to carry the address, instead repeating footage from a music and dance performance the previous evening. The mounting unrest and marred celebrations highlighted the deep divide running through this poorest country of the Western Hemisphere. Lawyers and jurists have refused to operate courts in protest of government interference. Students and teachers have been boycotting classes for weeks. Malnutrition afflicts two-thirds of the population, 80 percent are unemployed, and life expectancy has fallen to a hemispheric low of 49 years. On Monday, the national parliament will cease to function because deputies' mandates expire then and the government and rival political forces have failed to organize new elections.\n",

An opposition alliance trying to force President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to resign announced a new wave of protests -- including a two-day nationwide strike -- to show the depth of popular disenchantment with the once-beloved leader. Monday's appeal for an intensified campaign of civil disobedience follows violent clashes with police and pro-Aristide gangs during Haiti's bicentennial celebrations on New Year's Day. Eight people suffered serious injury when police fired into crowds in Port-au-Prince and Gonaives. One of the injured died Friday, bringing to at least 42 the number of Haitians killed in political violence since September. The anti-Aristide coalition hopes that mass street protests Wednesday and Sunday and a strike called for Thursday and Friday will send a message to the embattled president that his former constituency of workers -- and poor people -- has turned against him. Opposition groups say Aristide has employed corruption and human rights abuses in a desperate bid to stay in power. Aristide opponents insist fresh leadership is needed to restore order to the country. The economy is crippled by strikes, corruption and withholding of foreign aid, leaving as much as 80 percent of the workforce idle. Teachers, doctors, lawyers and judges have already stopped work to protest the government's repression of political opponents. Organizers of the general strike say they are pressuring all private businesses, even black-market street vendors, to halt commerce to show Aristide the strength and unity of his opposition. ``We can't stand still now. We have to continue mobilizing,'' said Marie-Denise Claude of the Backup for Democracy Committee, among the growing number of political parties and civil society groups seeking to drive Aristide from power and form a government of national reconciliation.\n",

The first centers on keeping America safe, with all its attendant challenges: Iraq, Afghanistan, the larger war on terrorism, military readiness, democracy promotion, foreign aid. The second has to do with keeping America sound: whether the government will collect enough funds to honor its commitments to future retirees and still meet its ongoing obligations to the poor and other vulnerable parts of the population; and how the burden of meeting those obligations will be distributed. There will be ample time to evaluate the incumbent's overall record, but there's no question that in the second basket of issues, having to do with fiscal health and fairness, President Bush has been pretty close to the ``miserable failure'' that his Democratic opponents describe on their campaign trail. He has lifted the taxpaying burden from those least in need of relief while recklessly setting the nation on a long-term path toward insolvency. It would be possible for him, in a second term, to undo some of the damage; but he shows so far no inclinations in that direction. The picture on national security is more complex. The gathering threats of al-Qaida terrorists; nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; and autocratic, anti-Western regimes were recognized before the Sept. 11 attacks but not met with sufficient urgency, neither by President Clinton nor, in his first nine months in office, by Mr. Bush. We have objected strenuously to many aspects of his response since, including the cavalier dismissal of allies abroad and a potentially perilous curtailing of civil liberties at home. But the president has risen to the challenge in a bold and serious way, understanding that defense against terrorism must include an active offense and beginning to shape a long-term strategy that includes the promotion of liberty and prosperity in parts of the world that enjoy neither. The challenge for the Democrats is to come up with a candidate who would be more responsible and compassionate on the fiscal side than Mr. Bush, while reassuring voters that he understands the seriousness of the security challenge and is competent to deal with it. Part of that reassurance has to do with biography. Four years ago we raised concerns about George W. Bush's minimal exposure to world affairs, and you can argue that the country has paid a price as Mr. Bush has learned on the job. This year it seems even more urgent to ask whether someone whose experience consists of governing a state with many fewer residents than Fairfax County, Va. -- not to mention less diversity and fewer social problems -- is the best prepared choice to lead the most powerful nation of the world. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean dismisses much criticism as the carping of the Washington establishment, and his partisans may attribute our concerns to the same kind of anxieties of a challenged elite. But in the post-Sept. 11 world, the risks of electing a rookie in military and foreign affairs are larger than ever.\n",

      "Indonesia's Partway Democracy. After three decades of dictatorship the strongman of a Muslim country finally was removed, producing scenes of jubilation but also a devastating outbreak of looting and the breakdown of law and order. With support from the West, the new regime promised democracy -- but many were dubious. They predicted the country would break up along ethnic lines, that Islamic extremists or nationalist generals would come to power, and that even if democratic elections were held, the resulting government would be unable to manage the country. As it turned out, none of those disasters has come to pass in Indonesia. Nearly six years after the overthrow of dictator Suharto -- and five after its first elections -- the world's largest Muslim country instead has merely a lot of problems. Terrorists linked to al-Qaida have carried out two major attacks in 18 months; corruption and poverty are rampant; in one province, a low-grade civil war drags on in which the army has been accused of major human rights abuses. Indonesia, however, is still a democracy. It will have at least two and probably three major elections this year. It is far freer than it was four years ago; its economy has stabilized; and its government, though not particularly friendly to the Bush administration, is on the right side of the war on terrorism. Indonesia, in other words, offers some broad ideas about what, in the best case, Iraq might look like in five years' time. It's a picture that wouldn't please human rights advocates, wouldn't make the case for Muslim democracy irrefutable and probably wouldn't silence opponents of the war. But it would represent a huge improvement over the previous dictatorship, and it would offer a reasonable prospect of further liberalization over time. Looking back at Indonesia's past half-dozen years, the lesson that leaps out is that democratic transition in a large, poor and potentially fractious country didn't produce either the chaos that pessimists expected or the democracy that some hoped for, but a complex and sometimes confusing mixture of the two, combined with lingering elements of the old order. The mix could persist for decades. What matters is the trend line -- whether such institutions as a free press, independent judiciary and civilian-run military are slowly gaining ground.\n",

      "Activist Donald Anderson: He Left the World a Little Richer. He was a peculiar man. Donald Anderson was a lawyer and a raconteur. He was a black man who had green eyes. He played the bagpipe. He never married. He wrote poetry and was devoted to the study of Shakespeare. He was cuttingly vain, and miffed that publishers didn't consider his writings to be as ``clearly brilliant'' as he did. There was something else: He said he communed with the dead. The dead were family members and former slaves who were buried on this former plantation in Eagle Rock, Va., north of Roanoke, where he kept a home. Traipsing around the graveyard, looking at Anderson's eyes twinkling furiously, I thought it all a little weird. That evening, seated at the dinner table -- he was also a mean chef -- Anderson kept referring to the slaves buried on his property as ``the folks in the back yard.'' It is doubtful we will ever see the likes of Anderson -- who died of cancer here Saturday at age 71 -- again. He was among the last of those old-line poverty workers (who knew Adam Clayton Powell, knew Martin Luther King Jr., knew Mississippi) at the forefront when there was something heroic -- in action, political deed, even song -- about attacking the ills of the less fortunate. For years he operated far beneath the radar. Now and then, however, he'd emerge to plead with a politician to come witness his ``rebellion'' at work. Anderson founded the National Association for the Southern Poor, which later became known as the Washington-based National Community Development Organization. He sought to give the poor a stake in their own destinations. It was an idea that grew out of his work with Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, D-N.Y., who headed the House Education and Labor Committee in the 1960s under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.\n",

      "Both Parties Have It Right, If Only They'd Work Together. The reason is the earned income tax credit, passed by Congress in 1975, one of the few anti-poverty measures that appeal to both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. The law benefits only those people who have jobs but who earn a relatively low wage -- the working poor and those near poverty. It thus reflects values at both ends of the political spectrum. Republicans like it because it rewards work, cuts taxes and doesn't fund a bureaucratic program. Democrats like it because it uses government to subsidize the meager pay of those at the bottom of the economy. This rare form of liberal-conservative coalition is essential to address a national shame: the millions of Americans whose hard work never propels them very far above poverty. About 22 percent of the country's labor force makes $8 or less an hour, according to Robert Lerman, an economist at the Urban Institute and American University in Washington, D.C. Among the 139 million people holding jobs for half a year or more, he calculates, about 29 million earn annual wages of less than $15,000. But it will take more than the earned income tax credit to help these folks, because poverty, or near-poverty, is not a single problem. It is many problems bound together in a cluster of mutually reinforcing hardships, and only a sweeping range of coordinated programs will make a difference. Liberals and conservatives each have only part of the picture. Liberals tend to pin the blame on society -- on shredded government safety nets, the stagnant minimum wage, greedy corporations that exploit menial labor and inadequate public funds for job training and secondary education. They are partly right.\n",

      "Peru's Mines Dig Deep at Local Discontent (Cajamarca, Peru). The armored trucks weave down roads misted by clouds, carrying bars of precious metal from the mine at the top of the hill. The destination is Lima, the seaside capital, then Europe -- a trade route Peru's gold has followed since the Spanish conquest five centuries ago. Gold mining is central to the economy of this high valley, and in recent years it has provided one of Peru's most impoverished areas with schools, roads and running water on a scale the government could never manage. But there is discontent in the towns below Latin America's largest gold mine, known as Yanacocha, which means black lagoon in the Quechua Indian language. The riches have brought resentment, particularly among those who have not won a coveted place on the mine's relatively small payroll. Many of those who do not work for the mine say it has brought minimal development, a higher cost of living and pollution to the rivers that for generations have provided irrigation for a patchwork of potato and corn crops. The debate over mining here mirrors a broader one taking place across Peru. There are mounting questions about an economic policy that has produced impressive growth figures but few jobs, especially for the majority of Peruvians, who live in poverty. Rising populist sentiment from Venezuela to Bolivia has stirred deep social unrest over how to harness the Andes' natural wealth, much of it in foreign hands, on behalf of the poor. Now the Newmont Mining Corp., the Denver company that holds controlling interest in Yanacocha, wants to begin working a barren, 14,000-foot dome filled with more than $1 billion in gold. The expansion is generating sharp public opposition while challenging Peru's government to reconsider how best to balance its export-dependent economy with the interests of needy communities.\n",

      "Africa's Dangerous Treasure. Recently Chad, one of the poorest nations in Africa, received its first income from the massive Chad-Cameroon oil and pipeline project, the continent's largest current investment. That ought to be a good thing. But unfortunately, oil production in African countries has often brought, instead of prosperity, greater poverty, destruction of the environment and violent conflict. All the more reason to wonder what will happen in Chad, a central African nation governed by a dictatorship best known for corruption and human rights abuses. The initial indicators are troubling. Soon after the project's official inauguration last October, the government closed down the country's only independent radio station, FM Liberti, which had close ties to the country's human rights organizations. Then residents of the capital city, Ndjamena, witnessed the first public executions in more than a decade. According to Chadian human rights advocates, the brief trial of some of the executed was a sham -- a sad chapter in the power struggle within the oil sector -- and was meant to send a clear message to critical voices in the country to be silent or risk their lives. This oil project was supposed to be different, thanks to an innovative partnership between the World Bank and an international consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp. The consortium made construction of the project dependent on the World Bank's participation as an insurance policy for its investments in a region that is a potential political powder keg. The World Bank, the single largest source of funding for development, co-financed the project, hailing it as a groundbreaking initiative in which oil wealth would be translated into direct benefits for the poor, while any damage to the environment would be repaired. Citizen organizations pleaded with the World Bank to postpone funding until Chad had built the capacity and established legal frameworks to ensure environmental protection, respect for human rights and transparent management of oil revenue. In response to these protests, the World Bank called for environmental studies, passage of a law in Chad to ensure transparency in the use of oil revenue and establishment of an oversight committee to monitor implementation of the law. These were indeed innovative and welcome measures. But Chadian human rights and development organizations feared that these good intentions alone were insufficient and called for more time to build government capacity. They also insisted on some solid demonstration of the government's commitment to reduce poverty.\n",

      "American Values and Iraq. After the Cuban revolution, in 1959, the United States infused defense and foreign aid with a new vigor. John F. Kennedy campaigned in 1960 as a cold warrior, and the following year he proclaimed a ``development decade'' in a speech in front of the United Nations. His assertiveness was compounded by the economic exuberance of the times. Cars sported extravagant tail fins; McDonald's was reinventing restaurants; American entrepreneurs and intellectuals were the world's smartest. Of course Kennedy's whiz kids could contain communist expansion. Of course they could triumph over global poverty. The echoes of our time are unmistakable -- and, in an unexpected way, revealing. After al-Qaida's attacks, in 2001, George W. Bush infused defense and foreign aid with an equally fresh vigor. He became an anti-terror warrior, and the following year he promised a huge jump in aid on the eve of a United Nations summit. His assertiveness was compounded by economic exuberance, too: Despite the Internet bust, a decade of extraordinary technology-fueled growth had enlarged America's idea of what was possible. Like Kennedy before him, Bush surrounded himself with brilliant and unhumble lieutenants. For Robert McNamara, the charismatic CEO who ran Kennedy's Pentagon, substitute chief executive Donald Rumsfeld. For McGeorge Bundy, the Harvard dean who served as Kennedy's national security adviser, substitute provost Condoleezza Rice of Stanford. We all know the fate of Kennedy's hubris in the military sphere. It led to Vietnam, a war that was right in the sense that the Iraq war is right: It was about standing up to a dictatorial regime with a threatening anti-American ideology. But the Vietnam War was simultaneously wrong. It was perceived as illegitimate -- by Vietnamese nationalists, by America's allies and ultimately by Americans. As a result, it was unwinnable. The fate of Kennedy's ambition in foreign aid is less well-known but just as interesting. Over the next three decades, aid bureaucrats escalated the battle against poverty, applying the same technocratic rationalism that led America to underestimate the importance of legitimacy in Vietnam. The parallel was no coincidence: A key architect of the buildup was McNamara, who left the Pentagon in 1968 to preside over the World Bank, where he spent more than a decade. During the McNamara 1970s, the bank's lending tripled and the scope of its efforts expanded at an imperialistic rate. In the 1980s the bank tried to fix the poor world with the package of technocratic economic prescriptions known as structural adjustment.\n",

      "Good News on Development. The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: This weekend's meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington promise to be relatively subdued. An ``unhappy birthday party'' staged by protesters opposite the bank's headquarters on Wednesday was quiet, and Saturday's demonstration won't match the chaos of the anti-globalization mobilization of four years ago. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for their part, are taking a break from announcing new initiatives, though there will be discussion of additional debt relief for poor countries. Yet the uneventful meetings should not obscure the major event going on in global development. The world is on track to halving the proportion of people in extreme poverty. In 1990, according to new figures from the World Bank's research department, 28 percent of the population in poor and middle-income countries lived below the $1-a-day line. By 2001, that proportion had fallen to 21 percent. The most dramatic advance occurred in East Asia, where the proportion living below the dollar line fell from 30 percent to 16 percent. South Asia was the other success story, cutting the rate from 41 percent to 31 percent. Meanwhile the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, and the transition economies of Europe and Central Asia, went sideways; in Africa the extreme poverty rate rose from 41 percent to 46 percent. Despite this regionally varied performance, the World Bank reckons that, if its projections for economic growth hold true, the global poverty rate will be down below 13 percent by 2015 -- less than half the 1990 level. Admittedly, because of population growth, the absolute number of people in extreme poverty is declining less dramatically. Over the past 10 years, the number of people under the dollar-a-day line has fallen by about 100 million, from 1.2 billion to 1.1 billion. Still, the proportional decline is remarkable. It means that the world is on track to meet the first of the Millennium Development Goals, the series of targets set by all the United Nations member states four years ago.\n",

Three kids were sitting there, with schoolbooks, papers and pencils all spread out, doing their homework. And Mom was helping as best she could while keeping straight the orders for Whoppers, fries and chicken nuggets. Given her low wages, this single mother was no doubt balancing more than fast food and homework; she was also deciding between paying the rent, going to the doctor and getting prescriptions when somebody gets sick -- or worrying about winter boots for her kids. I call her ``Burger King Mom.'' ``Soccer moms'' and ``NASCAR dads'' have received much attention in recent election campaigns. But who will speak to or for Burger King Mom? She may live in a red or blue state, but neither party is much interested in her or her family's issues. She is part of the low-income demographic most unrepresented in U.S. politics, with the lowest levels of both voter registration and turnout -- and with a high percentage of immigrants. Many low-income people have a hard time connecting to voting: it's too complicated, there are too many other things to worry about, and there is too little reason for confidence that the outcome will make much difference for them. The Republicans look after their wealthy constituents, and the Democrats want to be the champions of the middle class. Neither makes a priority of the needs of the poor. Is that because the problems of poverty are disappearing in America? Hardly. The poverty rate (including that for children) has risen over the past two years. More people than ever are without health insurance. Increasing numbers of people can't find affordable housing. The minimum wage hasn't been raised for seven years. Yet poverty is simply not a political issue. The ``p'' word came up in the Democratic primaries only in the speeches of John Edwards and, briefly, Howard Dean. It has not been mentioned since. John Kerry has hardly said a word about low-income families as he reaches out to the middle class. And George Bush's faith-based initiative has been reduced to a photo op, while domestic spending that most affects the poor has been drastically cut in favor of war, homeland security and tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The media have yet to report on the condition of low-income American families who have also become the casualties of war.\n",

      "Belarus' Terrorist Ties. When Saddam Hussein's closest aide, Abid Hamid Mahmud Tikriti, was apprehended in Iraq a year ago, U.S. officials were alarmed to find him carrying Belarusan passports not only for himself but also for other high-ranking members of the former regime -- including Saddam's two infamous sons. A year later Washington's continuing concern about this matter is understandable, given that some of Saddam's top officials and others in his regime may have escaped via Syria to the European pariah state of Belarus during and after the war. Belarus has a history of close cooperation with rogue states, and of extremely poor relations with the United States. Nevertheless, before the Iraq war, Washington ignored signals that clearly indicated Belarus was not only Iraq's most active ally in Europe but was also willing to provide refuge for members of Saddam's regime. Belarus may have been the only country where Saddam's henchmen might have expected to find government-sanctioned safety. It is Europe's last Stalinist state and is controlled by an erratic leader who was among Saddam's closest allies. It is also a country that, according to the United Nations was perhaps the worst violator of U.N. arms sanctions against Iraq, secretly assisting Saddam with ballistic missile development and supplying Baghdad with advanced antiaircraft defense equipment and training. Belarus' dictatorial president, Alexander Lukashenko, made Saddam such a key military, political and economic partner that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in testimony to Congress a year after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, singled out Belarus as the country most likely to accept Saddam if he were to flee Iraq. While this testimony was largely ignored by the media and seemingly forgotten by Rumsfeld, Belarus actually increased its cooperation and assistance to the Iraqi regime to the point where Saddam's son Uday was scheduled to make a high-profile visit to that country in March of last year. The outbreak of war was the only reason this much-hyped trip did not take place. Saddam Hussein did manage, however, to dispatch Baghdad's then-mayor, Adnan Abed Hamed, to Belarus two weeks before hostilities began to publicly thank the government for its strong support and to tour a truck factory that is widely believed to have supplied Iraq with vehicles that were adapted to carry missiles.\n",

Sitting on a mat and holding his son's frail hand, Mohammed Ishaq and his wife, Aisha, have been here five days, nursing 9-month-old Zohar on drops of water from a large pink cup, praying that somehow he will survive. Zohar spits up the water. His cough is rough, and his thin skin clings to his ribs. His withered left arm is connected to an IV. He is suffering from malaria, complicated by malnutrition. Near him, other parents rock, nurse and pray for their babies, who are passed out or moaning, their eyes rolled back as they vomit emergency rations of corn and oil.

      "Next in Darfur. The greatest humanitarian catastrophe since the Rwandan genocide is at last getting the attention it deserves. Over the past two days Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan have paid visits to Darfur, the western Sudanese province where more than 1 million people have been chased out of their homes by government-backed militia forces, and where the death count in unsanitary and undersupplied refugee camps is likely to exceed a third of a million. Powell and Annan aimed to impress on Sudan's government that inaction in the face of this suffering will not be tolerated, and the pressure appears to be working. Having deliberately created this crisis, Sudan's rulers now promise to rein in their militia allies; to stop impeding humanitarian access to Darfur; and to open political talks Friday with Darfur's rebels, whose uprising provoked the monstrous policy of burning villages, turning farmers into refugees and waiting for them to die. The first challenge over the coming weeks will be to hold Sudan to these commitments. Given the space to do so, the government will doubtless revert to its pretense that the plight of Darfur is exaggerated. There is ``no famine,'' the foreign minister declared on Tuesday, notwithstanding reports from aid workers that famine-related deaths are running at about 1,000 per week. Equally, a government that oozes contempt for the lives of its own citizens cannot be trusted to control their assailants. When students in Sudan's capital tried to deliver a petition this week to Annan about the plight of Darfur, security forces opened fire on them. To ensure that Sudan sticks to its commitments, the United States and its allies must push ahead with a U.N. Security Council resolution that threatens members of the Sudanese regime with sanctions if the commitments are not met. The second challenge is to seize the opportunity to get relief supplies into Darfur. Torrential rains are starting to make roads impassable, so this will require a major airlift as well as procurement of relief supplies on a large scale. The United Nations has appealed for $350 million to finance a relief effort, and Thursday a World Health Organization official, newly returned from the region, said it would take a fleet of 20 helicopters to contain outbreaks of cholera and dysentery in the 137 refugee camps spread out across Darfur, an area the size of France. But donor governments have come up with less than half of the money that is needed. According to a U.N. count of firm commitments since March, the United States has promised $62 million, Britain about $11 million. But Germany, France and Japan have each promised less than $4 million. The tightfistedness of these allies is outrageous, as is the reluctance of France and other members of the U.N. Security Council to support a tough resolution on Darfur. To excuse their failure to contribute to Iraq's reconstruction, these nations complain that the Bush administration's Iraq policy was insufficiently deferential to the United Nations. But none other than the U.N. secretary general has just visited Darfur to demonstrate the urgency of humanitarian action. What excuse can there be now?\n",

      "A Green Pragmatism. The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON -- At the end of its long march from the fringe to the mainstream, the international environmental movement confronts a challenge. Now that the world has accepted the basic message that the environment matters, campaigners have to move beyond denouncing everything that has an environmental cost; they have a duty to say which costs are most serious and how the expense of mitigating them should be apportioned. The difficulty of rising to this challenge is illustrated by the fractious relationship between the environmental movement and the World Bank. The most recent clash between the two sides -- centering on the bank's lending to extractive industries, especially oil -- shows that some environmental groups continue in a utopian, denounce-everything mode. The bank is rightly fighting them. The latest clash begins with an independent commission set up at the bank's behest, which recently published recommendations on mining and oil projects. Many were reasonable: The commission stressed the advantages of using renewable fuel; it pointed out that extractive industries have often stoked corruption; and it emphasized that people living around such projects, who put up with the environmental risks, should be consulted during project design and should benefit from the proceeds. In responding last week, the World Bank's management accepted these ideas. But it refused one of the commission's demands: that it should completely cease lending to oil and coal projects. This last demand overlooks the facts that poor countries need energy and that the alternatives to oil and coal may not be preferable. More than 1.6 billion people have no access to electricity, and 2.3 billion depend on wood and other ``biomass'' fuels, which cause deforestation and pollution. Another potential fuel source is hydropower, but the environmental movement has resisted construction of dams. Other options include wind and solar power, but telling poor countries to solve their problems by those means is hypocritical, given that rich countries have taken only baby steps in that direction. Oil and coal will remain central to development, with or without the World Bank's backing. To pretend otherwise is to imply that the poorest countries in the world must shoulder the cost of fighting global warming. By getting involved in oil and coal projects, moreover, the World Bank can improve the chances that they will be well managed. In Chad, for example, the bank has overseen the development of an oil field that environmental groups predicted would be disastrous. The construction of a subterranean pipeline has been completed safely, with minimal damage to the rain forests it travels through or to the people who live in the region. The World Bank has also overseen the creation of an institution controlled partly by Chadian nongovernmental organizations and partly by the government to ensure that oil revenues reduce poverty; if Chad's government proposes to spend oil money on something that won't benefit the poor, the new body theoretically has the power to veto it. It is too soon to say whether this experiment will succeed in disciplining Chad's corrupt and autocratic rulers. But the bank is at the forefront in grappling with the curse of oil in developing countries; mandating its withdrawal from the sector would be misguided.\n",

Fadul, 47, talks emotionally about the twin opportunities in Iraq: to make money and to rebuild his homeland. ``We believe that there is a good opportunity there to build up a democratic nation, a wealthy country,'' said Fadul, of suburban College Park, Md. ``That was where we were born, so we would love to see the place that we suffered in grow nice.'' Iraqis living outside of Iraq are pouring $5 million a day into private enterprises in the country, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

Others, like Boston architect Hisham Ashkouri, are attempting major development projects. Ashkouri is trying to raise $115 million, and has sunk $450,000 of his own money into a hotel and theater complex he wants to build in Baghdad.

Jordanian immigrants sent home $1.64 billion in 2001, according to the World Bank, far outweighing the $432 million that country received in international aid.

Jittery eyes followed as the statuesque, copper-skinned man settled into an armchair. He was recently accused by Secretary of State Colin Powell and others of leading a marauding militia that has turned the Darfur region of western Sudan into the most desperate humanitarian crisis in the world. But Hilal had a different story. He said the crisis was overstated, and offered to give tours of the vast region, where he spent most of his life. ``I'm a big sheik,'' he said in a rare interview last week. ``Not a little sheik.'' Hilal is accused of being a commander of the Janjaweed militia. According to human rights groups, aid workers and the United States, the militia, supported by Sudan's government, has displaced 1.2 million people in Darfur though violence and pillage. What was once a lively crossroads between Africa and the Arab world has become a tableau of hunger, disease and fear. U.S. officials have pressed the Sudanese government to end its support of the Janjaweed and hold Hilal and six other commanders accountable for the crisis. Powell, in a visit to the region last month, urged the government to disarm the militia and end the violence. But just days after Powell's trip, and a similar visit by U.N.

The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON -- Like a man who sees a child drowning and won't plunge in to save him, the world is failing Darfur, the western Sudanese province where more than a million civilians have been driven from their homes by the government and its militia allies. The failure is most glaring in the case of France, which acknowledges ``the world's most serious humanitarian crisis'' and calls for ``the mobilization of the international community,'' as the French ambassador wrote recently to The Post. Despite maintaining a military base in neighboring Chad and another in Djibouti, France refuses to supply the United Nations relief operation with needed helicopters or to enforce a no-fly zone that could end the Sudanese military's aerial attacks on villagers. But no powerful nation is free of blame. The Bush administration, which has been generous with relief and which has led the charge for tough action at the United Nations, is guilty of equivocation too. The equivocation hinges on the question of who must restore peace in Darfur. On Thursday Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered his answer: ``The burden for this, for providing security, rests fully on the shoulders of Sudan's government.'' This view conveniently absolves outsiders of responsibility for getting a civilian protection force into Darfur and reassures Security Council members such as China and Russia that Sudan's sovereignty will be respected. But it is naive. Sudan's government has attacked civilians with helicopter gunships. It has armed a militia that burns villages, slaughtering the men and raping the women. It has spent months obstructing humanitarian access to the resulting refugee camps, denying aid workers visas and impounding their equipment in customs, condemning tens of thousands of people to die for lack of food and medicine. Even the recent ramping up of diplomatic pressure, which has allowed relief to flow more freely, has not distracted Sudan's government from its purpose. Its commandants have been closing down refugee camps and sending inhabitants off into the torched countryside, where there is no food, no protection and no foreign witnesses. Asking a government like this to provide security in Darfur is like calling upon Slobodan Milosevic to protect Albanian Kosovars. The real solution is the reverse of the one Powell appears to believe in. Rather than summoning Sudan's government into Darfur to protect refugees, the United States should be calling upon the government to pull back from the region. Just as was the case in Kosovo, security in Darfur is going to require a foreign presence, preferably an African one that builds on the small African Union observer mission that is already in the region. Powell may fear that calling for such a force is risky: What if no Africans come forward, and the job of peacekeeping falls to the United States? But the secretary must weigh that risk against the opposite one. What if Sudan's government maintains control of Darfur and uses it to exterminate hundreds of thousands of people?\n",

      "Frist, in Africa, Calls Sudan Situation `Genocide'. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., on Friday visited exhausted Sudanese refugees who had crossed into Chad after fleeing attacks by an Arab militia in the Darfur region of western Sudan. He called the crisis ``one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time.'' Frist met with aid workers and toured the Touloum camp where 15,000 refugees live in dust-covered tents, fragile shelters vulnerable to rain and wind. The militia, called the Janjaweed, has committed atrocities across Darfur that have displaced close to 1.5 million African villagers and left an estimated 50,000 dead, human rights groups and aid workers say. Frist said that the violence was ``specific to a group of people, with race playing a major role in intent. It is genocide.'' The House and Senate passed measures last month also declaring the situation a genocide and urged President Bush to seek a U.N. protection force. One of the refugees in the camp, Amer Osman Adam Abdullah, said he spent 18 days walking from his village in Darfur to the border with Chad. He displayed frayed identification cards indicating that he had been a community leader. But now he helps organize the camp, a leader among the desperate. Using a bullhorn, he urged the refugees to clean up trash. In the pocket of his button-down shirt were two pens, which he said he used to record new arrivals at the camp. Abdullah said no one would return to Darfur because of the security situation. He thanked Frist and the United States for humanitarian aid and said, ``If you go with us, we will go home,'' repeating the request for U.S. intervention voiced by other refugees.\n",

      "Next Steps on Darfur. The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post: One month ago, the U.N. Security Council demanded progress on the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Darfur. A resolution called on Sudan's government to allow aid workers unimpeded access to the province and to rein in the genocidal Janjaweed militia that has chased more than a million people from their homes. The deadline for compliance passed on Monday, but compliance has been halfhearted. Aid workers' access has indeed improved, proving that U.N. pressure does influence the government's behavior. But the government has made only a superficial attempt to rein in the Janjaweed, and a U.N. team reported last week that attacks against civilians continue. If it wishes its resolutions to be taken seriously, the Security Council must follow through on its threat to impose sanctions when it meets Thursday to consider Sudan. That is not the main thing the Security Council must do, however. The concept of last month's resolution was flawed from the outset, in that it was calling upon the main instigator of Darfur's crisis to become the savior. Having dispatched helicopter gunships to shoot down civilians, and having armed a militia that has burned children to death and raped mothers, Sudan's government cannot suddenly become the source of security that persuades traumatized refugees to return to their homes. Security can come only when a serious foreign force arrives in the territory. The African Union, which already has 300 personnel in Darfur, is willing to provide 3,000. Ensuring their deployment must be the main objective of Thursday's Security Council meeting. The African troops will need Western money and logistical support, as well as assistance in planning their mission. But the clearest obstacle to their deployment is the fact that Sudan's government opposes it. To break down that opposition, the Security Council must call explicitly for African peacekeepers to go into Darfur. It should also keep some sanctions in reserve and hint strongly that Sudan's chances of avoiding further penalty will depend on its willingness to invite in the African Union. The United Nations should also mandate a commission of inquiry to gather evidence of crimes against humanity in Darfur. The prospect of prosecution in an international court should capture the attention of Sudanese leaders. Why might the Security Council shrink from this course? The argument that Sudan's government is already making a good-faith effort to control the militia is unconvincing. According to Human Rights Watch, the government allows the Janjaweed to maintain 16 bases in Darfur, including five that are shared with the government's own forces, presumably because it still regards the Janjaweed as a useful ally in its struggle against two Darfuri rebel groups (whose human rights record is not good, either). But even if one were to agree that Sudan's government is trying to do the right thing, why object to the deployment of African peacekeepers to assist it? The answer is that there is no reasonable objection, but Sudan's sympathizers at the United Nations, led by China and Pakistan, seem determined to hold up Security Council action that might make the deployment happen.\n",

      "Red Tape Stifles Third World. This editorial appeared in today's Los Angeles Times: Many of the world's poorest countries are kept afloat only through massive amounts of foreign aid and debt relief. But outsiders can't do it alone; governments in these poor nations must be willing to be friendlier to domestic businesses. A report issued last week by the World Bank suggests that these countries start by reducing the thicket of regulations that keeps citizens from founding and growing new businesses. Without regulatory reform, the World Bank predicts, poorer countries will fall even further behind as richer rivals make it easier for existing businesses to grow and for entrepreneurs to create start-ups. The report makes for sobering reading. It costs more in poorer countries to fire workers, enforce contracts and gain access to capital than it does in richer countries. When regulations are simplified, the number of new businesses swells. In Ethiopia, for example, new businesses rose by about 50 percent after regulations were streamlined. The World Bank isn't advocating the abandonment of regulations that protect the environment and the rights of workers. It instead focuses on bureaucracies that make it difficult for new businesses to spring to life. The organization's second-annual review of red tape around the world suggests that richer countries have found an appropriate balance: ``All the top countries regulate, but they do so in less costly and burdensome ways.'' And American business leaders who moan that this is an increasingly unfriendly place to do business should note that the U.S. sits near the top of the World Bank's list of countries where it's comparatively easier and less costly to clear regulatory hurdles.\n",

      "How Africa Subsidizes U.S. Health Care. This Wednesday is World AIDS Day: It will be marked by concerts and candlelit vigils from Armenia to Zambia. The speeches and statistics will have a horrific familiarity: Two decades after the first diagnoses, AIDS shows no signs of letting up. And yet the debate about AIDS is changing subtly. In Africa, the epicenter of the crisis, the shortage of cash and affordable medicines is no longer the prime issue. Attention is turning to the shortage of health workers, and hence to a dark aspect of globalization. It isn't a surprise that Africa is short of doctors and nurses: The continent has 1.4 health workers per 1,000 people, compared with 9.9 per 1,000 in North America. What's shocking is that this shortage is partly created by rich countries. Poor nations such as Malawi and Zambia are paying to train medics who emigrate to staff the hospitals of the United States and Europe. We should be helping Africa. Instead, Africa is subsidizing us. Not just slightly, either. Ghana trains 150 doctors annually; five years after graduation, 80 percent have left, according to Ghanaian data reported by the World Bank. For pharmacists, the proportion is about 40 percent; for nurses and midwives, it's about 75 percent -- which is why half the nursing posts in Ghana are vacant. Meanwhile, South African doctors emigrate at a rate of about 1,000 annually. In 2001, Zimbabwe graduated 737 nurses; 437 left for one country, Britain. Medical migration is not a new phenomenon. Sabina Alkire and Lincoln Chen of Harvard cite the (non-African) example of the Philippines: In 1970 more Filipino nurses were registered in the United States and Canada than in their home country. But the migration is accelerating. In 2001, the number of emigrating Filipino nurses was three times higher than in 1996. Likewise, the number of non-European Union nurses and midwives in Britain has jumped more than tenfold in a decade. This isn't a scandal; it's more complex than that. Development economists have traditionally celebrated migration as a route out of poverty: If a cab driver moves from Lima, Peru, to Los Angeles, his income whizzes up even though his skills remain the same. Moreover, the immigrant cab driver may send money home to relatives; such remittances to poor countries are twice the size of official development assistance. Harvard's Dani Rodrik calculates that further liberalization of visa rules could benefit the citizens of poor countries more than liberalized access to the rich world's outrageously protected markets for farm goods.\n",

      "Afghanistan's Minor Miracle. Finding bad news about Afghanistan is easy: The media brim with stories of its travails. For starters, there's the Taliban, which remains a threat, particularly in the south and east. Although scattered by American firepower in late 2001, its fighters continue routinely to kidnap and kill foreign aid workers and to attack Afghan and Western troops. Moreover, Afghanistan today is less a state than a precarious balance-of-power system in which warlords with private armies rule the provinces, paying the central government scant heed. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, derisively known as ``the mayor of Kabul'' because of his minimal power, has survived one assassination attempt already and moves about cocooned by American bodyguards. Afghans remain dirt poor and largely illiterate, lacking the barest necessities, such as clean water. There are few modern roads; electricity is unavailable in most places and spotty even in Kabul. Now famine looms; a relentless drought has dried up rivers and irrigation canals. This destitution has revived poppy cultivation, which was suppressed by the Draconian Taliban, and opium is again the principal export. Amid the torrent of such dismal news it's worth remembering that life in Afghanistan was far worse not long ago. Recalling Afghanistan's terrible past lends perspective and keeps its achievements in view, which is essential lest pessimism culminates in its abandonment by the West -- yet again.\n",

      "A Shift on Darfur. The Bush administration signaled a new course on Sudan last week, and none too soon. A month ago it made the mistake of turning the diplomatic spotlight away from Darfur, where Sudan's government is perpetrating genocide, to peace talks between the government and rebels in the south. But now Stuart Holliday, the administration's third-ranking representative at the United Nations, has suggested that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan should visit Darfur to refocus the world's attention on the genocide. Holliday and Annan have also revived discussion of U.N. sanctions on Sudan's government. The renewed emphasis on Darfur has been forced by events on the ground. After the United States sponsored a U.N. resolution last month that shifted attention away from Darfur, the government felt free to resume its killing there. On Dec. 8 it launched an air attack on a village called Marlla; on Dec. 11 it attacked another village, Ishma; the next day the government's allies in the Janjaweed death squads looted and burned other settlements nearby. On Dec. 18 the government followed up with a helicopter assault on the village of Labado, torching its buildings before moving on to other targets; again, the Janjaweed looted and destroyed property in the wake of the government attacks. Darfur's rebel groups, whose violence had been contained by the hope that international intervention might protect them, have grown more desperate and vicious. Perhaps hoping to provoke a reaction that would draw the world back into the crisis, the rebels have attacked police outposts and relief convoys, sometimes killing aid workers. The result is that the tenuous gains of the summer, when Darfur briefly grabbed the world's attention, have been partly undone. Access for humanitarian workers, which the government blocked earlier this year as part of its policy of eradicating civilians, has deteriorated: Relief workers are being denied visas, and the Sudan chief for the aid agency Oxfam has been ordered out of the country. Violence is compounding the problem. Last week, following the deaths of four employees, Save the Children withdrew 350 workers from Darfur who had been delivering food and medical supplies to 250,000 people. Meanwhile, the opportunity created by the government's agreement to allow in cease-fire monitors from the African Union has been clumsily exploited. The troops are arriving at a snail's pace. And peace talks between the government and Darfur's rebels broke up Dec. 21 without results. The United States has done more than any other country to control this catastrophe, which may already have claimed 300,000 lives. It has been frustrated by China and Russia, which have sold weapons to Sudan and used their muscle on the U.N. Security Council to undermine a push for sanctions; by the sluggishness of the African Union, which accounts for the slow deployment; and by the need to preserve diplomatic capital for the war on terrorism and for Iraq. But the Bush administration must press for tougher action. It must revive the threat of U.N. sanctions, which succeeded in restraining Sudan's government over the summer, and be ready to face down a possible Chinese or Russian veto; it must push for a peacekeeping presence. It must persist in this effort because the administration itself determined three months ago that Darfur's killings amount to genocide -- a policy of targeting ethnic Africans in the region and killing as many as possible.\n",

      "Help for Indonesia. The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON -- As the full horror of last week's earthquake and tsunami in southern Asia slowly becomes known, Indonesia is emerging as the center of one of the biggest natural disasters in history -- and as a focal point for concern about long-term social, economic and political aftershocks. Two-thirds of the death toll, which by the weekend had risen to more than 120,000, has been recorded in and around the island of Sumatra, and particularly within the poor, isolated and war-torn province of Aceh. With one sizable town just 60 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, Aceh suffered an extraordinary double blow: first a shock wave about 200 times as powerful as the Los Angeles earthquake of 1994; then a tsunami that sent waves from the seashore to the foot of mountains more than a mile inland. The town of Meulaboh, once home to 120,000 people, may have lost a third of its population last Sunday morning. Lagoons stand where once there were thousands of homes. At least half a million people have been displaced, and disease and famine still threaten those who survive. Beyond the immediate humanitarian emergency, the disaster will pose a critical challenge to stability in the world's largest predominately Muslim country, a fledgling democracy that was just beginning to find its feet when the earthquake struck. With a population of 238 million spread over 17,000 islands, Indonesia has been the site of some of the greatest threats and most hopeful developments in the war on terrorism. Islamic militants linked to al-Qaida have carried out three major bombings in the past two years, and they pose an ongoing threat. But the country is also a center for moderate Islamic thinking, and three democratic elections were successfully staged there last year. The last, in September, handed the presidency to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a moderate former general who hopes to consolidate secular civilian rule and prove that democracy can bring Indonesia the booming economic growth it experienced under dictatorship in the 1980s and '90s. U.S. relations with Indonesia are friendly but uneasy: As elsewhere in the Muslim world, President Bush is deeply unpopular. The administration consequently has not only an urgent interest in supporting a democratic government in its moment of crisis but also an opportunity to earn desperately needed goodwill by responding aggressively and generously. Regrettably, Bush got off to a slow start, failing to speak publicly about the disaster for three days and initially committing less government aid than American citizens and businesses have volunteered. By the end of the week a policy more equal to the challenge was emerging: Bush multiplied the U.S. aid pledge by 10, dispatched two naval battle groups to the Indian Ocean and delegated Secretary of State Colin Powell as well as his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to travel to the region beginning today. The U.S. delegation has a lot of ground to cover: Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, among other affected nations, are also important American friends. But as it fashions a post-disaster policy, the administration should ensure that the United States is second to none in providing short- and long-term relief to Indonesia. From this terrible tragedy, some good -- in the form of deeper American support for a struggling Islamic country -- can still come.\n",

      "Relief Distribution System Slow and Spotty. Rukaiyah's right arm has swollen dangerously, pus leaking from an angry gash along the inside of her elbow. The skin has yellowed on a forearm puffy all the way to the wrist. Unchecked infection has led to the threat -- and maybe the onset -- of gangrene. But Rukaiyah, 28, has not seen a doctor since a torrent of water destroyed her home a week ago in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh province, and swept her along for hundreds of yards in an uncontrollable surge marked by multiple collisions with churning debris. The mosque where she has found refuge along with 1,000 other tsunami victims has not been visited by medical personnel, refugees said. Moreover, it has run short of tarpaulins to shelter from the rain, short of rice to eat, and short of pots and stoves to cook it in. And yet Bung Bak Yok, this little village where Manassa Mosque has responded to last week's disaster as best it can, lies only three miles east of Banda Aceh's Sultan Iskandar Muda Airport, where planeload after planeload of relief supplies and emergency medical teams have begun pouring in. A week into one of South Asia's most devastating disasters in history, an international campaign to help Indonesia recover has at last moved into gear, with the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft delivering food, medicine and tents. But from the airport on, the distribution system slapped together by still reeling local officials and visiting international aid groups has proved spotty at best. In camp after camp, village after village, people like Rukaiyah have yet to receive all the help they need. ``The distribution system is not working,'' said Nassir Khan Abdurrahman, a Malaysian Red Crescent volunteer who has logged more than 30 years' experience responding to natural disasters in Asia. ``They know where to send it, but they have their friends, they have their families.''\n",

      "Haphazard Charity. The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: President Bush stepped up his response to the tsunami Monday, announcing that flags would be flown at half-staff in memory of the victims, and enlisting his two immediate predecessors to campaign for private donations to disaster relief groups. After a tragedy that has killed an estimated 150,000 people and left as many as 5 million homeless, this response is welcome, as is the outpouring of international generosity that has generated $2 billion of promised contributions in just over one week. But it's hard to avoid marveling at the haphazard pattern of global empathy. Around the world, disasters that cut short hundreds of thousands of lives unfold constantly -- malaria kills 1 million people a year, AIDS kills about 3 million and the current genocide in Darfur has claimed perhaps 300,000 lives so far. Moreover, the tsunami is not the sort of disaster for which outside help is most crucial. Outsiders' assistance can deliver two things: resources, primarily money but also tents, medicines, helicopters and so on, and technical experts. The tsunami-afflicted countries are fairly well-endowed with both of these. India has already announced that it has the money and know-how to repair the damage it has suffered, and it has also extended help to its neighbors in Sri Lanka. Thailand is a middle-income country with a gross domestic product per person of $2,000, making it twice as rich as Honduras and five times richer than Kenya. Sri Lanka and Indonesia are somewhat poorer, but still far from the bottom of the development rankings. Both countries will continue to experience strong economic growth, because tourism and fishing, the two industries disrupted by the tsunami, represent a small share of output. However terrible the human destruction, this is not like the currency crisis of 1997-98, which left high flyers such as Indonesia with economies that shrunk by more than a tenth in the space of a year. The affected nations will have plenty of their own resources for reconstruction. It's also likely that the expertise needed to put broken communities back together will be primarily local. Unlike extremely poor countries, which often lack administrators who can conceive or implement policy, the countries of South Asia have been doing a pretty good job of managing their own development. The biggest reconstruction challenge, in the Indonesian province of Aceh, may be an exception. The tsunami destroyed the structure of the local government by killing many of its employees, and a separatist conflict in the province makes intervention by the central government and army more complicated. Even there, however, the new structures that fill this administrative vacuum are more likely to come from Indonesian authorities than from foreign aid agencies who parachute into the region. The locals know the region and the language; outsiders often do not. None of which is to say that the world's response to the tsunami has been excessive. Aid agencies have experience in coping with disasters, and this can complement the local knowledge of disaster-struck countries. Foreign logistical support, such as that being delivered by U.S. Seahawk helicopters in northern Sumatra, can widen crucial bottlenecks in a relief effort. In the medium and long term, the expertise amassed inside agencies such as the World Bank on disaster preparedness should be part of reconstruction planning. The United States has a chance to improve its relations with a key Muslim nation by acting aggressively to help Indonesia. But this extraordinary outpouring of generosity ought to prompt a re-examination of the rich world's relationship with far-off misery. If donors can find $2 billion in the space of one week, why does total government assistance to fight continuing development disasters run at just $60 billion or so per year? Now that we know the world's pockets are this deep, couldn't they be opened more frequently?\n",

      "Tsunami Aid Pledges May Be Overstated, Experts Say. In the three weeks since the Indian Ocean tsunami ripped up coastlines in Asia and Africa, the United Nations has credited more than 40 governments, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank with unprecedented pledges of assistance valued at nearly $4 billion. But a closer look at those commitments shows that hundreds of millions of dollars in those pledges had already been committed to development projects in the region. And as much as half of the offers are for interest-free loans, which the United Nations traditionally does not count as humanitarian aid. The tsunami relief effort illustrates how large pledges of aid have historically yielded far less cash than was promised for humanitarian relief and recovery efforts. And it underscores why the United Nations -- which asked for nearly $1 billion to fund its tsunami relief and reconstruction efforts over the next six months -- remains concerned that money may not be available to finance relief efforts, despite commitments made worldwide. ``I will not be surprised if we do not get all the money'' pledged by governments, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters. ``This is the history we live with.'' Over the past two years, the United Nations has faced a shortfall of $3 billion in funding for relief operations and for rebuilding countries devastated by civil conflicts or natural disasters. In many cases, countries simply have not followed through on large public pledges of support.\n",

      "After the Tsunami. The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: The unprecedented generosity in response to Asia's tsunami has reflected the sense that this is a different sort of tragedy. Many disasters in poor countries are caused or exacerbated by human failings: Famines often are created by war; tornadoes kill people in large numbers where authorities have failed to plan for them; the long-term problems of poverty frequently reflect corrupt or incompetent leadership. But the tsunami was an act of nature that rose up from the ocean; although helter-skelter development of coastal areas may have compounded the damage, the people of rich countries perceived the tsunami as a case of pure misfortune. And so the charitable response has been enormous. The success of the relief effort, by contrast, is bound to depend on the competence of governments. National pride may prove an obstacle: India's government refused foreign help, and then was slow to deliver assistance to the remote Andaman Islands; Indonesia's government has forbidden U.S. Marines from staying overnight on its soil, which has restricted the U.S. role in clearing rubble and in reconstruction; Burma's dictators as usual seem more interested in preserving their positions than allowing help to reach their citizens. Indonesia has also announced that foreign aid workers must register with its officials before leaving the two main towns in Aceh, a requirement that may become onerous if implemented restrictively. Beyond the question of national pride, government leadership of reconstruction can be good, bad or indifferent. One of the mistakes made in previous disasters was to allow feeding camps to spring up far from people's dwellings; this separated survivors from their pre-disaster lives and delayed their return to self-sufficiency. That's why it has been essential to deliver relief supplies to people in remote regions rather than forcing those people to trek into the towns in search of help. Helicopter drops of food, coupled with an urgent effort to re-establish road links so that traders can move goods, have rightly been early priorities. Another potential mistake is to allow a flood of foreign help to destroy local coping mechanisms. Food aid may be essential in the immediate aftermath of a disaster but can drive local food prices down if sustained for too long, hurting local producers. Conversely, an inflow of foreign money can drive local prices up to the detriment of consumers. Policymakers must steer a path down the middle. Aid must also be distributed to reach the most vulnerable groups, because famines and medical shortages often reflect not an absolute scarcity but rather a lack of purchasing power among the poorest. If supplies are simply dropped from a helicopter, some will muscle their way forward and walk off with them, selling them to those compatriots who can afford them.\n",

      "A Practical Plan to End Poverty. Americans know a good deal when they see it. Now a group of leading scientists and practitioners from several fields -- agriculture, medicine, economics, education, engineering -- is making a proposal to the world. If rich and poor countries will follow through on the promises they have made over the past five years to fight extreme poverty and disease -- and rely on the best science and technology in doing so -- the world can save millions of lives and extricate hundreds of millions of its poorest people from the trap of extreme poverty. The cost is a mere 50 cents out of every $100 of rich-world income in the coming decade. The point is simple. Consider malaria, a silent tsunami whose devastation washes over Africa at a proportion that dwarfs the recent Indian Ocean tsunami. Each month more than 150,000 African children die of malaria; that's about the death toll of the Asian disaster. Yet those deaths do not sear the public's mind. Off camera, they are largely unknown. On top of the tragedy and vast economic cost, they contribute to the continent's population explosion, as impoverished Africans have large families to counter the ever-present threat. The shocker is that malaria, unlike an Indian Ocean earthquake, is largely preventable and utterly treatable. There is no excuse for the millions of malaria deaths that will occur this year. A $5 dollar mosquito bed net specially treated with insecticide, used widely throughout rural Africa, could dramatically lower the rate of malaria illness and death. Effective medicines, at roughly $1 per dose, could treat cases that slip by the bed nets. Yet Africa's poverty is so extreme that rural farm families know about the bed nets and medicines -- and long for them -- but can't afford the few dollars they would cost. Monday's report of the Millennium Project, an independent advisory group to the United Nations, shows that $2 to $3 per American and other citizens of the rich world would be needed each year to mount an effective fight against malaria. The rich world's actual spending to fight malaria is closer to 20 cents per person per year. The report, ``Investing in Development,'' doesn't stop at malaria, though controlling it might be the greatest bargain on the planet. The project's scientists show how special ``fertilizer trees'' could replenish Africa's soil nutrients and lead to a doubling or tripling of food crop yields in just a few years, enabling farmers to grow more food more reliably and break free of famine. Using these and other cost-effective modern tools, Africa could have its own ``green revolution,'' as Asia did some decades ago. As in Asia, food security in Africa would be a prelude to sustained economic growth.\n",

      "Extreme Poverty Could Be Ended, U.N. Told. The world could end extreme poverty within a decade if wealthy nations fulfilled their pledges to increase development aid, Columbia University economist Jeffrey D. Sachs said Monday as he presented a plan to the United Nations for achieving that goal. But if those countries' governments don't come through with what they have already promised, the poor will continue to get poorer and the world less secure, he said. ``We are not asking for one new promise,'' he said. ``Only the follow-through on what has already been committed.'' Sachs is leading the United Nations' Millennium Project to meet development goals adopted by world leaders at a summit in 2000, including eliminating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. Almost 3 billion people live on less than $2 a day, and the report spells out the investments needed to elevate them above the level of bare survival and provide them with the means of leading productive lives. ``Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals'' is the result of a yearlong study led by 265 top development experts and is designed to show ``not only that it can be done, but how it can be done,'' Sachs said.\n",

      "A Tale of Two Texans. Forty years ago Thursday, Lyndon Johnson took the presidential oath on the steps of the Capitol, and American -- and inaugural -- politics have not been the same since. Before Johnson became president, the United States had not had a president from the South since Zachary Taylor died in office in the summer of 1850. In the 40 years since Johnson's landslide victory, southerners have been president for 24 years -- at least if we grant Poppy Bush's claim that he was really a Texan. By ending southern exceptionalism, by steering to passage the great laws that ended legal segregation and enabled southern blacks to vote, Johnson made it possible for southerners to run for president freed from the burden of defending a profoundly racist system. He made it possible for them to win. The young Johnson entered politics as the most avid of New Dealers, and the New Deal, as historian Jordan Schwarz in particular has demonstrated, was in good measure directed at bringing living standards in the South up to those in the rest of the nation. By establishing a national minimum wage and public power systems to electrify vast rural areas, FDR intended to fast-forward the development of America's most underdeveloped quadrant. As a 26-year-old New Deal administrator who employed jobless young men to build roadside parks all across Texas, and then as a young congressman who sped the electrification of his state's Hill Country, Johnson developed a lifelong faith in the capacity of government to better people's lives. That faith, as much as anything else, was the basis of Johnson's much-maligned War on Poverty. For all the attacks leveled then and since on Johnson's programs, the numbers tell a different, far happier tale. In 1959, 22 percent of Americans lived in poverty. By 1973 that figure had fallen to 11 percent, and it has never climbed back to anywhere near its pre-Great Society levels. Poverty among the elderly in particular fell from 35 percent in 1959 to 10 percent today -- numbers to remember as we consider dismantling Social Security. Thursday a very different Texan will take the presidential oath. To be sure, George W. Bush has handled Iraq no better than Johnson handled Vietnam, but in domestic matters he is the anti-Johnson through and through. Bush's vision is to get people off the government's grid, not put more on. He calls this the ``ownership society,'' and it would be a lovely vision if everyone could afford to buy into it.\n",

      "The Gates Vaccinations. The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: It can be frustratingly hard to turn money from the rich world into progress against global poverty. An aid program can finance the purchase of school textbooks or the construction of a well. But the books are lifeless without competent teachers, or if parents depend on child labor and don't want to send their kids to school. Equally, the well won't help much if it's not maintained, or if the politics of the village leave the poorest without access to it. But there's one type of aid that escapes many of these obstacles. Vaccination programs can protect millions of people from debilitating diseases. And once the vaccines are delivered, the gains are locked in: No matter how tough the environment around the vaccinated people, their health will still be protected. This is why vaccinations offer some of the clearest development wins, and why the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is right to devote huge resources to them. (Full disclosure: Melinda Gates is on the board of The Washington Post Co.) More than 2 million people die each year for lack of immunizations that are standard in rich societies. In 1999 the foundation, which is financed by a gift from the Gates Microsoft fortune, made a $750 million grant to address the vaccination shortage in poor countries. Monday the foundation followed up with another gift of $750 million. The Gates grants are cleverly structured. The first one served to launch the Vaccine Fund, the financing wing of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which promotes access to vaccines in poor countries. This transformed the incentives of the pharmaceutical industry. Before, the industry had little reason to manufacture vaccines for which there might be no market; after, a multimillion-dollar pot of cash hung like a carrot in front of drug companies. Moreover, the Gates contribution spurred other donors to contribute, too. Over the past five years, the Vaccine Fund has raised $580 million from other sources, notably $219 million from the United States and $150 million from Norway. Monday the announcement of a second Gates grant was accompanied by a promise of a further $290 million from Norway. Thanks to the Vaccine Fund, an extra 42 million people have already received the hepatitis B vaccine, and vaccines for yellow fever, influenza and other killers have also had their reach extended. As a result, an estimated 670,000 deaths have been prevented. But there remains vast scope for progress. Some 27 million children still aren't immunized each year; the price of this failure was 2.1 million deaths in 2002 alone, according to the World Health Organization. Moreover, new vaccines are in the development pipeline -- for meningococcal disease, pneumococcal disease and rotavirus diarrhea -- and these could save an additional 1 million lives per year or more if donors supply the money to purchase them. The Gateses' smart philanthropy is a wonderful thing. But it would be even better if other donors, public and private, reacted yet more generously to this second grant than they did to the first. The opportunity to prevent needless death awaits them.\n",

      "N. Koreans Fleeing Hard Lives Discover New Misery in China. After five days of hiking in the biting cold, Lee Shanyu made her escape from the other bank of the Tumen River, where the tortured land of North Korea ends in a row of barren brown hills crusted with frost. The promise of a bribe to North Korean border guards got her to the river's edge, she recalled, and a furtive midnight trot across the frozen water got her to this side of the border, where she said the police all seemed to be indoors trying to stay warm. And so in the middle of the night, pale, penniless and poorly clothed, another desperate North Korean had washed up in China. ``I decided to take a chance,'' Lee, 25, said to explain her risky flight across the border Feb. 20. ``We have to do something,'' she added in an interview, fighting back tears as she recalled the mother she left behind. ``We can't make a living in North Korea.'' Every day, according to aid workers, a handful of North Koreans make the same decision, driven by hunger, want and oppression. The lucky ones find their way to South Korea, a few by sneaking into embassies in Beijing, some by traveling to neighboring countries to get help. Others get picked up by Chinese police and sent back. But many -- aid workers estimate the total is more than 200,000 -- end up working underground in China, trapped by their illegal status in menial labor, prostitution, concubinage or petty crime. The daily trickle of asylum-seekers along China's 800-mile-long northeastern border goes a long way to explain why Beijing resists U.S. pressure to squeeze North Korea harder over its nuclear weapons program. Like U.S. officials, Chinese authorities want North Korea to abandon its effort to build a nuclear deterrent. But they also have been careful not to do anything that would further destabilize their neighbor's already decayed communist system.\n",

      "U.S. Makes First Grant in Reformist Foreign Aid Program. Three years after President Bush proposed linking U.S. foreign aid to good governance, his administration on Monday awarded the first such grant: $110 million over four years to help Madagascar fight poverty and expand property rights. The package of funds is expected to be the first in a series of Millennium Challenge Account grants awarded this year. The Bush administration designed the Millennium Challenge program after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in an attempt to foster reforms that emphasize human rights, education and economic equality in some of the world's poorest countries, many ruled by authoritarian regimes. While the program's intentions have been widely applauded, there has been concern that it has gotten off to a slow start. ``Everyone thinks the concept is very positive and very good. People like this idea,'' said Wendy R. Sherman, a top diplomat in the Clinton administration. ``But it has to be operationalized'' or it soon will lose credibility among target nations, she warned. Paul V. Applegarth, head of the Millennium Challenge Corp., which administers the program, rejected such criticism. In an interview earlier this year, he noted that while the president first articulated his vision for the program in 2002, the government corporation did not come into existence until January 2004.\n",

      "An `Anti-Terror' Tyrant. This editorial appeared in Friday's Los Angeles Times: President Islam A. Karimov of Uzbekistan has wrapped himself in the flag of anti-terrorism and done well by it: hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid, a U.S. military base that demonstrates the close ties between Tashkent and Washington, and bland statements from the United States about his country's appalling human rights record. But the killing of civilian demonstrators by government forces in an eastern Uzbekistan city last week demands a public outcry from the U.S. That may not be in Karimov's interest, but so what? A dictatorship that allows no meaningful political opposition fails to serve the broader interests of the country or its friends. It drives support toward the only groups able to organize against the government: Islamic fundamentalists. Uzbekistan is the largest country in Central Asia, with 26 million people. It is desperately poor, which was a factor in the demonstrations. Protesters said they wanted more freedom and better living conditions. When armed assailants staged a raid on a prison and freed inmates, including 23 businessmen allegedly allied with a banned Islamic group, demonstrators took advantage of the confusion to protest in the streets. Witnesses said troops opened fire on demonstrators, killing several hundred and wounding many others. The government Tuesday denied shooting civilians, saying all those shot were armed ``terrorists'' who were killed by ``rebel'' guns. Karimov also accused foreign media of calling his regime a tyranny. That's precisely what it is. Thousands of political prisoners are in jail. Torture is common. The government controls the practice of Islam. The rare outbreaks of protest always end with Karimov cracking down, saying he's only fighting terrorists.\n",

      "Darfur's Real Problem. The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: Sudan may be extremely poor, but its spin doctors are sophisticated. The suffering in Darfur is terrible, they say, but don't blame the government. The violence is a function of generalized anarchy, which is a function of underdevelopment, which is a function of the West's failure to help: To chastise Sudan's impoverished rulers is therefore hypocritical. Rather than urging punitive sanctions, outsiders such as The Post should urge engagement and assistance. So how do the spin doctors explain this week's news? On Monday Sudan's government showed its real feelings about Western help by bringing charges against the Sudan director of Doctors Without Borders, an intrepid medical charity that runs clinics in Darfur. The next day it detained the charity's Darfur coordinator. Over the past six months, the government has arrested or threatened more than 20 foreign aid workers in Darfur -- not exactly evidence of an appetite for Western engagement. The idea that Darfur's crisis is not really the government's fault has never fit the facts. In response to a rebellion by two local armed groups, Sudan's government attacked civilians with helicopter gunships and armed a local militia to raze villages. Then, far from soliciting international help to deal with the humanitarian fallout, Sudan's government actually blocked aid groups' access to Darfur. Its policy toward displaced people was to deprive them of food, sanitation and protection: in other words, to kill them. Recently, government troops and their militia allies have engaged in a systematic policy of raping civilians. Doctors Without Borders has been targeted this week because it documented these offenses. The harassment of aid workers poses an immediate risk to Darfur's 2 million or so displaced people, who have been unable to plant food and so remain dependent on Western assistance for the near term. But it also poses a challenge for outsiders. Western diplomacy toward Sudan has oscillated between the pressure that we and others advocate and the engagement that implicitly endorses the government's claim that Darfur's suffering reflects anarchy and poverty. Sometimes the United States has persuaded its allies to threaten to bring U.N. sanctions against Sudan. But at other times outside nations have treated the government as a partner that's constructively bringing the violence under control; they've pledged large amounts of aid to support the tentative North-South peace deal on the theory that this will help solve the Darfur crisis. Sometimes, in other words, the world has treated Sudan's government as though it were the cause of Darfur's suffering. And sometimes it has acted as though it might be the solution.\n",

      "Vietnam and Human Rights. The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: President Bush is scheduled to meet Vietnam's prime minister, Phan Van Khai, Tuesday at the White House, a mark of the transformation in U.S.-Vietnamese relations since the war that ended 30 years ago. Mr. Khai is visiting the United States with a large entourage of officials and business executives; he has toured a Boeing plant and dropped in on Bill Gates of Microsoft; he is due to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange and visit Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These symbols of warming relations are mostly welcome. But they should not obscure the fact that Vietnam remains a place where a citizen can be sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for the crime of denigrating Communist Party officials in e-mails. Mr. Khai hopes that his visit will build U.S. support for Vietnam's entry into the World Trade Organization, and there is no reason to deny him that. The Vietnamese economy has grown at an average of 7 percent per year over the past decade, thanks largely to a boom in the southern half of the country, which has responded vigorously to steady economic liberalization. As a result, Vietnam's poverty rate has fallen from about 60 percent to less than 30 percent, an achievement that ranks along with China's as one of the greatest development success stories ever. Vietnam, like China before it, wants to lock in its economic progress by joining the WTO, membership in which would require further pro-market reforms. The United States has an interest in encouraging emerging economies to become part of a rules-based international system, so it should welcome Vietnam's overtures. The Bush administration is also interested in developing a defense relationship with Vietnam. U.S. naval vessels have made calls at Vietnamese ports, and the administration wants to include Vietnamese officers in its military training programs in the United States. Again, some measure of military cooperation is reasonable. The East Asian security balance could be upset in the future by a rising and assertive China or by North Korea's willingness to provoke the nuclearization of its neighbors. The United States must play its part in keeping a lid on these tensions; it has a large stake in the stability of a region that has become a leading destination for U.S. direct investment. Cultivating security relationships with Vietnam and other countries in the region is a prudent investment. But these agendas -- economic and military -- must be balanced against the equally important agenda of democracy and human rights. Precisely because the United States has an interest in stable development in East Asia, it should be skeptical of a development model that's based on government control of the media and the imprisonment of dissidents; if a government fears its own people, how stable can it be? Equally, the United States is most likely to be influential in the region if it is seen to stand by its appealing values rather than making opportunistic alliances with dictators, as it has to its own detriment in the Middle East. For these reasons, Mr. Bush must use Tuesday's meeting to push a two-sided agenda: more economic and military cooperation on the one hand, more democracy and freedom on the other.\n",

      "Bid to Cut Housing Subsidies Decried. The Bush administration's proposal to eliminate many of the federal rules requiring public housing authorities to serve extremely low-income people has generated widespread concern among housing advocates who say the change could prove ruinous for the nation's poorest families who have nowhere else to turn for affordable housing. The proposal, pending in Congress since earlier this spring, would allow local housing authorities to charge higher rents, provide lower subsidies and limit the amount of time tenants can remain in federally subsidized housing to as little as five years. Taken together, the changes would amount to one of the most dramatic policy shifts in the 68-year history of public housing. Bush administration officials say the proposal suits the president's vision of promoting self-sufficiency and encouraging home ownership. But advocates and local housing officials worry that the changes will result in a reduction in an already inadequate supply of housing affordable to people mired in deep poverty. ``The changes would harm households with the most severe affordable-housing needs,'' said Douglas Rice, director of housing and community development for Catholic Charities USA. ``The shortage of affordable housing is one of the primary causes of homelessness, and extremely low-income households are most at risk of becoming homeless.'' The proposal expands on previous administration efforts, largely thwarted by Congress, aimed at reducing long-term dependency on federal housing subsidies. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson, testifying before a House committee last month, said the plan would encourage tenants to move into market-rate rentals or to buy homes, with federal help for down payments and closing costs.\n",

      "Sustaining Quake Relief Over the Long Term. Colin Powell was right. When it comes to providing relief to millions afflicted by natural and man-made disasters, the United States is anything but stingy. Each year, our government provides well over $2 billion for lifesaving relief activities throughout the world. Our contribution to the World Food Program represents more than half of the organization's resources, and we provide the office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees with nearly one-third of its annual budget. The disaster assistance response teams of the U.S. Agency for International Development, already assessing conditions and providing relief in India, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka following last week's undersea earthquake, are among our most dedicated and effective public servants. Their efforts are supported by a network of U.S. private voluntary organizations providing food, shelter, sanitation and emergency health assistance. I am convinced of the Bush administration's commitment to this tradition of U.S. leadership, as I was involved in the administration's first effort to respond to a major natural disaster. On Jan. 26, 2001, shortly before the end of my eight-year tenure as the National Security Council official responsible for humanitarian aid issues, a major earthquake struck Gujarat, India. I was certain that both the U.S. military and our civilian aid providers had roles to play, but I didn't know what to expect from a new administration that had campaigned hard against the involvement of the military in operations other than war. My doubts were dispelled when both the new national security adviser and her deputy pressed successfully for a generous response that included U.S. troops. It was therefore hardly surprising when U.S. officials took umbrage last week at comments by Jan Egeland, the U.N. undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, who suggested that the United States and other governments are tightfisted with foreign assistance. But before dismissing Egeland's comment, it is worth noting that it was focused not on the immediate relief effort but on what comes next -- after the crisis abates, after CNN departs and after the attention of the world is focused elsewhere. Will the United States sustain its willingness to help meet rehabilitation and development needs in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other affected countries in the months and years to come? This is a perfectly reasonable question. Over the past several decades, the United States, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has been far better at responding effectively to natural disasters and man-made emergencies, from the Balkans to Africa, than it has been at addressing the needs that follow. Even with the president's proposal in 2002 to increase substantially the U.S. commitment to development assistance, the United States was still spending less than 0.2 percent of its gross national income on development aid in 2003, putting us at the bottom of the 20 or so industrialized countries. With hundreds of thousands of people in dire need in the tsunami area, it is difficult to focus on anything other than the immediate relief and recovery challenge. Nonetheless, the United States and other donors must also organize themselves for longer-term challenges, such as reconstructing homes, schools and factories, disaster mitigation training and the creation of an Indian Ocean tsunami early warning system. The key is to focus on both the short and long terms, but with a keen awareness that we are better at the former than the latter.\n",

      "pipeline. Northwest China's Shaanxi Province  has worked out an emergency aid scheme to ensure the safe  operation of the country's massive west-to-east gas pipeline that  runs through nine provinces and municipalities including Shaanxi.

The pipeline, under high-pressure operation, is vulnerable to  natural disasters and man-made damages, the experts said, adding  that gas leaks could lead to fire, explosion or gas poisoning. There are a lot of hidden dangers due to insufficient  coordination between the local government and the pipeline  administration company, according to the experts. Under the newly established emergency aid scheme, however, the  relevant departments have developed a long-effective regular  mechanism to take charge of the joint safety supervision and  prevention measures, which will be effective in finding and  eliminating the hidden dangers, the experts said.\n",

Finance ministers of the Group of eight most industrialized  nations (G8) agreed in London on Saturday to cancel at least 40  billion dollars in debt owed by the world's 18 poorest countries,  including 15 African countries. \"These measures give a real hope,\" Annan said at the meeting  with French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister  Tony Blair over a UN initiative to promote a good conduct for  businesses in developing countries. The initiative, known as UN Global Compact and launched in 2000 is backed by some 1,000 worldwide companies, including 250 in  France, which are committed to the respect of 10 principles,  notably human rights, working conditions, environment and anti- corruption efforts. Annan also affirmed to continue to plea for rich countries'  pledge in favor of an increased aid, debt relief and market  opening, referring to the G8 summit to start next month in  Scotland and the UN summit in September in New York. The two  meeting are expected to decide new measures to finance the poor  countries' development.\n",

New World Bank President Paul  Wolfowitz said in Burkina Faso on Wednesday that he is happy with  the cancellation of debts owed to the World Bank and other lending organizations by 18 of the world's poorest countries. Wolfowitz said after his meeting with President Blaise Compaore that Burkina Faso, which is among the countries benefiting from  the debt cancellation, will be provided with more resources to  fight poverty. The money coming from the debt cancellation will be given to  the people and the World Bank will work together with the  government to make it happen, said Wolfowitz, who is on his first  Africa trip since taking over as the World Bank chief. Finance ministers from the world's richest countries agreed  over the weekend to cancel 40 billion US dollars of debt owed to  the World Bank and other lending organizations by the world's 18  poorest nations, most of them in Africa. After a 48-hour tour in Burkina Faso, Wolfowitz said the World  Bank's priority in the country is to deal with problems related to equal rights between men and women, to ensure that every one has a chance to take part in the country's development.\n",

The famine facing Southern Africa is a mounting concern in the  region, as statistics of the starving have risen to more than six  million people in Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe,  and Swaziland.

The Chinese government sets great store by cooperation with the United Nations and other international organizations, and has  actively strengthened its exchanges and cooperation with other  governments and women's organizations around the world. China is  serious about implementing international conventions. In May 2000, it submitted to the United Nations The Report on the  Implementation Result of the People's Republic of China of the  \"Beijing Declaration\" and the \"Platform for Action\" Adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995; in February 2004, it  submitted The Fifth and Sixth Regular Reports on the  Implementation of the UN \"Convention on the Elimination of All  Forms of Discrimination Against Women;\" and in March 2005, it  submitted The Report on the Implementation of the People's  Republic of China of the \"Beijing Platform for Action\" (1995) and  the Document of Results of the 23rd UN General Assembly Special  Session (2000). II. Women and the Economy The state has made the guarantee of equal employment  opportunities between women and men and the sharing of economic  resources and results of social development the top priority for  the advancement of gender equality and the development of women,  and has worked out and adopted a series of policies and measures  to ensure that women can equally participate in the economic  development, enjoy equal access to economic resources and  effective services, enhance their self-development ability and  improve their social and economic status. Encouraging women to start business and become re-employed.  Employment is the basis of people's livelihood and the basic  economic resource that women rely on for subsistence. Over the  past few years, the Chinese government has formulated and carried  out supportive policies to encourage women to start businesses on  their own initiative, and give them preferential treatment when  granting employment training subsidies and small-sum guaranteed  loans and conducting tax reduction and exemption. In the meantime, governments at all levels have adopted many favorable policies  toward women, such as creating public-welfare jobs, opening  employment service centers, sponsoring special recruitment  activities and vocational training courses, monitoring sex  discrimination against women in employment and help women,  especially laid-off women, to find new jobs. With the support of  the government, women's federations at various levels, trade  unions and other NGOs have conducted their work regarding the  employment and re-employment of women in a creative way. During  the period from 1998 to 2003, women's federations nationwide  endeavored to get small-sum credit loans to directly aid a total  of 2.5 million women to get re-employed. Over the past decade, the number and ratio of women employed have remained fairly high. By  the end of 2004, the number of both urban and rural women workers  reached 337 million nationwide, accounting for 44.8 percent of the total employed; and the number of women workers in urban work  units stood at 42.27 million, accounting for 38.1 percent of the  national total.

In recent years, the Chinese government has  adopted active policies and measures to solve the problems  concerning agriculture, rural areas and farmers, increased its  input into agriculture, pushed forward tax reform in rural areas,  and implemented the strategy of invigorating agriculture by  applying science and technology. Government departments and  women's federations at all levels have jointly organized  activities to encourage rural women to acquire knowledge and learn science and technology, and compete in their development and  contributions, so as to bring their role in invigorating and  developing the rural economy into full play. Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of rural women working in cities. Over the past few years, the Chinese government has gradually reduced or eliminated the restrictive regulations on the employment of rural people in cities, and made great efforts  to solve the problems of salaries in arrears, vocational safety,  equal pay for equal work and social security for them so as to  relieve rural migrant workers of anxieties regarding residence  registration in cities and the schooling of their children, and  actively protects the legitimate rights and interests of rural  women working in cities. At the same time, the state also  encourages and supports the building of training schools and legal aid centers, and the publication of typical cases of infringement  as a means to raise awareness of their rights among migrant women  workers and enhance their ability to safeguard their rights in  accordance with the law. To actively promote gender equality in employment and raise  women's ability to find employment or start businesses, the  Chinese government has begun to cooperate with the United Nations  Development Program, International Labor Organization and other  international organizations, with satisfactory results.

Years of economic retrenchment during almost four decades of  occupation have increased poverty, reduced and distorted  production and heightened dependence on Israel, said the United  Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

The report recommends that the focus should be on forming  institutions that will serve the needs of an upcoming Palestinian  state rather than aiming solely at reforming a transitional  government, and the efforts for economic revival should target  poverty reduction while expanding production and trade. UNCTAD proposes that the Palestinian Authority pursue \"a  development-driven approach to trade rather than a trade-driven  approach to development,\" through a gradual and sequenced  framework towards liberalization.\n",

The MDGs, adopted in the millennium UN summit, include a series of concrete objectives in fighting poverty, reducing hunger,  expanding primary education, and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS, among others. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa called for \"collaborative  efforts between the developed and developing countries to  accelerate global efforts\" to achieve the MDGs and applauded  recent efforts to provide more resources for development,  including debt relief. Ecuadorian President Alfredo Palacio said the MDGs are \"a  minimal, not a maximal agenda, a starting point, not the end. This basic commitment must be assumed by all the governments of the  world.\"\n",

      "Full text: Beijing Action for Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia (2). I. CONTEXT Composing the most disaster-prone region of the  world and home to more than a third of the world's population,  Asian countries suffer disasters every year. The increasing  vulnerability of people in Asia is largely related to the  demographic conditions, rapid technological and socio-economic  changes, hugely expanding urbanization and development within high risk environment, among other conditions. The impact of such  catastrophic events in Asia as the frequently occurring typhoons  and tropical cyclones, annual floods of increasing severity, the  Bam earthquake in Iran in 2003, and especially the Indian Ocean  tsunami of 2004 underline the costs of the loss of lives,  livelihoods and material damages. Additional impacts go far beyond direct social and economic costs in the resulting and often  long-termed psychological and frequently pervasive public health  or environmental shocks to Asian societies. Given the numerical magnitudes, professional talents and  dynamic features of many Asian economies and their importance to  world trade and commerce, no country in the world today is immune  to disasters. The current global concern about the rapid  international spread of a possible pandemic disease such as Avian  Flu is only one example that conveys both the urgency and the  necessity of sustained investment in widespread public awareness  on disaster risks and governmental commitments to disaster  preparedness, response and reduction through regional cooperation. Recurring disasters pose a great development challenge for all  countries in Asia. The impact of disasters is on the rise and the  need for relief assistance is increasing. Therefore, increasing  emergency relief assistance reduces resources for development  expenditure. Also, disaster events push socio-economically  marginalized people into poverty, increasing their dependency on  natural resources. This, in turn, degrades the environment and  further increases their vulnerability to disaster risk. To break  such a negative cycle and to sustain socio-economic development,  disaster risk reduction should become an integral part of  sustainable development, evident in all annual programming  actions. Meanwhile, there is now a clear understanding that the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) cannot be achieved without  consideration of disaster risk, and that sustainable development  cannot be achieved unless disaster risk reduction is mainstreamed  into development policies, planning and implementation. It is  widely acknowledged that disaster reduction perspectives should be incorporated into every country's national development plans and  related implementation strategies. The good news, however, is that technology now provides the capability of and opportunity for  better understanding of disaster risks and taking proactive  actions to reduce disaster losses before they occur. This context has influenced the outcome document of WCDR: the  Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of  Nations and Communities to Disasters. This document was adopted by the UN Member States that participated in the WCDR, demonstrating  a global commitment to disaster risk reduction in the context of  development.\n",

Economic pressures are eroding the already low levels of  protection of agricultural workers in terms of wage levels, job  security, health, safety and environmental standards and social  protection, the report said. Agricultural workers, who do not own or rent the land on which  they work, are often poorly paid, earning wages well below those  earned by industrial workers. In general, worker households spend  over 70 percent of their cash salary on food, according to the  report.\n",

According to the FAO, three out of four people suffering from  hunger live in rural areas and depend on natural resources such as land and water for their survival. \"If we want to reduce hunger and poverty in the world, we must  go to the root causes of the problem,\" said Parviz Koohafkan,  executive secretary of the conference. \"In the poor rural zones, one of the main problems is the lack  of secure access to factors of production, particularly land and  water,\" he added.\n",

      "Countries appeal for help to small islands countries. Seven Heads of State and Government  and some 60 Agriculture Ministers and government officials  representing 30 countries on Thursday issued a declaration in  support of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The Rome Declaration considered the development of agriculture, forestry and fisheries to be of \"vital importance\" for national  economic growth, social stability, environmental resilience and  the elimination of poverty, hunger and malnutrition in SIDS. Following a one-day summit at the headquarters of the UN Food  and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the leaders expressed their  strong belief that SIDS have a right to receive \"special and  differential treatment.\" The leaders called for the sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong  to pay greater attention to the \"special needs and specificities  of small states.\" They said the increasing erosion of preferences, the rush to  introduce high tariff reductions, and the inadequate support to  domestic supply response and adjustment capacity were critical  concerns for SIDS. The leaders said unless these concerns were  adequately addressed, it would be difficult for SIDS to engage in  any significant trade liberalization processes.\n",

      "FAO urges complementary policies for agricultural trade. Only days ahead of next week's World  Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong, the UN Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Wednesday warned that the  benefits of agricultural trade reform may not reach the poor  unless urgent complementary policies and investments are made. The FAO's report \"State of Food and Agriculture 2005 (SOFA 2005) \" examines agricultural trade and poverty, seeking to answer the  question: Can trade work for the poor? According to SOFA 2005, the answer is yes, but trade  liberalization alone is not enough. Policies and investments must  be put in place to allow the poor to benefit from trade  opportunities and to protect the vulnerable against trade-related  shocks. The FAO report says that industrial countries have the most to  gain from agriculture trade liberalization, because their  agriculture sectors are the most distorted by existing policies. \" Consumers in currently protected markets and producers in  countries with low levels of domestic support would tend to gain  the most.\" Developing countries as a whole would also benefit from  liberalization, but SOFA 2005 warns that some groups could be hurt in the short run. Those groups include net food importing  countries and countries that have been given preferential access  to the highly protected markets of wealthier member countries of  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n",

      "   by Huang Haimin  Bui Minhlong. Vietnam has seen higher economic  growth this year, especially stronger export and foreign  investment, in spite of facing big unwanted incidences such as  bird flu outbreaks, natural disasters and increased world prices  of many key materials. Vietnam will post gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.4  percent this year, compared with the target of 8.5 percent and  last year's figure of 7.79 percent, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said recently. Meanwhile, it is expected to see growth of 16.5 percent in industrial and construction value, 8.4 percent in  services and at least 20 percent in export, all of which are  higher than the set targets. Vietnam's Trade Ministry estimated that the country's export  revenues will surge to 32.1 billion US dollars this year from 26.5 billion dollars last year, due to mainly higher world prices of  many key items such as crude oil, coal, rubber, rice, coffee and  cashew nuts. The country is also forecast to lure 5.8 billion dollars of  foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2005, up from 4.2 billion  dollars last year. It attracted FDI of nearly 5.3 billion dollars  in the first 11 months of this year, a year-on-year surge of 40.3  percent, the Foreign Investment Department under the Ministry of  Planning and Investment told Xinhua recently. Vietnam has made good progress in other fields, including  poverty reduction, job creation and healthcare provision. In 2005, the country is estimated to create 1.6 million jobs, slash the  percentage of malnourished children aged under five to 25 percent, and lower the poverty rate to 7 percent from 24.1 percent in 2004  and 58.1 percent in 1993.\n",

IV On Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The United States is the richest in the world, but its poverty  rate is also the highest among the developed countries. In the  United States, problems such as poverty, hunger and homelessness  are quite serious, and the economic, social and cultural rights of working people are not guaranteed. A study of eight advanced countries by London School of  Economics in 2005 found that the United States had the worst  social inequality, Reuters reported on April 25, 2005. The poverty rate of the United States is the highest in the developed world  and more than twice as high as in most other industrialized  countries (Newsweek, The Other America, Sept. 19, 2005). In recent years the fortunes of the rich have continued to rise in the  United States. According to two new studies by Spectrem Group, a  Chicago-based wealth-research firm, and the Boston Consulting  Group, millionaire households (excluding the value of primary  residences) in the United States controlled more than 11 trillion  dollars in assets in 2004, up more than 8 percent from 2003 (  Millionaire Ranks Hit New High, Wall Street Journal, May 25,  2005). Meanwhile, the income of ordinary employees in the United  States has seen a sharp decline, causing the increase of poor  population. The data issued by the U.S. Census Bureau said that  the nation's official poverty rate rose from 12.5 percent in 2003  to 12.7 percent in 2004, with the number of people in poverty  rising by 1.1 million from 35.9 million to 37 million, which means one in eight Americans lived in poverty. Poverty rates in cities  such as Detroit, Miami and Newark exceeded 28 percent. The New  York Times reported on Nov 22, 2005 that in 2004 3.9 million  families had members who were undernourished.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  will provide 1 million U.S. dollars of grant to Afghanistan to  help it enhance the role of  private sector in economic growth and poverty reduction, said ADB on Thursday. One of the key challenges facing Afghanistan is establishing a  supportive environment for the country's large and mainly informal private sector, which is estimated to control as much as 89  percent of the country's gross domestic product and employs about  1.7 million people, said ADB. However, the private sector contributes just six percent of the economy's gross domestic capital formation while accounting for 92 percent of consumption, said ADB. \"This in part reflects a lack of general awareness of potential business opportunities and limited business development skills, it also reflects the absence of incentives for the private sector to  formalize its activities,\" says Eugenue Zhukov, an ADB Principal  Economist. The program will support reforms that will lead to private  sector growth in the country by directly addressing the key issues that constrain investment and entrepreneurship, such as a lack of  an enabling legal and regulatory framework, unfair business  practices and limited access to much needed business development  services and financing.\n",

Research has shown that pastoral  livestock production systems among communities living in Africa's  arid and semi-arid lands still provide the surest means out of  poverty. Research undertaken among the Masai in Kenya and Tanzania has  revealed that the poorest pastoral families and those most  vulnerable to droughts are those that have been dispossessed of  communal lands and livestock through the on-going large-scale  privatization of rangelands in favor of conservation and  commercial crop farming. Dr. Ernestina Coast of the London School of Economics Thursday  told a policy research conference in Nairobi that despite  widespread diversification into non-livestock activities,  livestock production remains key to the well being of pastoral  communities in Eastern Africa. \"Livestock remains absolutely vital for pastoral livelihoods in both Kenya and Tanzania, while incomes from conservation  activities are performing poorly,\" Dr Coast told participants of  the meeting on Pastoralism and Poverty Reduction in East Africa  organized by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). Rangelands in sub-Saharan Africa have undergone dramatic  changes in ownership and utilization that have greatly restricted  nomadic pastoralists' access to key pastures, water sources and  even migration routes.

UN Secretary-General Kofi  Annan said Tuesday that the failure to stop the Iraq war was the  worst moment of his 10 years in office. \"I think the worst moment was the Iraq war which as an  organization we couldn't stop and I really did everything I can to try to see if we could stop it,\" he said at his last press  conference when asked about his top achievements and worst moments in his tenure. Among the achievements, he cited the UN's human rights efforts, the war against inequality both between and within states and the  battle for development as epitomized by the Millennium Development Goals that seek to slash a host of social ills, such as extreme  hunger and poverty, infant and maternal mortality and lack of  access to education and health care, all by 2015. He pleaded that the UN not be judged by the Iraq oil-for-food  scandal but by its myriad humanitarian and development actions. \"I think that when historians look at the records they will  draw the conclusion that, yes, there was mismanagement and there  may have been several UN staff members engaged but the scandal, if any, was in the capitals and with the 2,200 companies that made a  deal with Saddam behind our backs and of course I hope the  historians will realize that the UN is more than oil-for-food,\" he said.\n",

      "Full Text: China's National Defense in 2006 (23). Civil Air Defense Civil air defense (CAD), air defense of critical areas and  field air defense constitute China's homeland defense structure.  The tasks of the CAD in the new era are to protect the people and  their property and China's economic development in wartime, and  carry out disaster prevention and relief and handle public  unexpected incidents in peacetime. The CAD expenses are born by  the state and the public. The state has promulgated the Civil Air  Defense Law, and the people's governments at various levels have  formulated and improved corresponding CAD rules and regulations.  CAD work is incorporated into plans for economic and social  development by the people's governments at and above the county  level. China's CAD capabilities in preparations against war,  integrated urban protection and public unexpected incident  response have been greatly enhanced in recent years.  Interconnected and interoperable communications networks for  command and warning at the provincial, city and county levels have been basically established, and urban air defense early-warning  networks have been improved. Over 85 percent of areas in major  cities are covered by air-defense sirens. Most of the key CAD  cities have CAD command posts. All large and medium-sized cities  have protection and rescue contingents for emergency rescue, rush  repair, medical aid, fire fighting, maintenance of order, chemical defense, epidemic prevention, communications and transportation.  Short-term and full-time training courses are conducted, and  emergency rescue drills for handling disasters are organized to  help the public acquire CAD knowledge and skills. CAD courses are  included in school teaching programs and curricula. Volunteer CAD  teams have been formed in some factories, mines, enterprises and  communities. Militia Force Building China's militia is under the unified direction of the State  Council and the CMC, and the dual leadership of local Party  committees and governments as well as the military commands. The  concept of people's war, and the principle of combining regular  work with military training and combining peacetime needs with  wartime needs are observed in the building of the militia.\n",

A leading Chinese human rights expert on Thursday lashed out at a report accusing China of widespread rights abuse, saying the report is \"completely groundless\" and its authors have a \"Cold War mentality.\" Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based group, released its annual report on Thursday which criticized a handful of countries -- including China -- for poor rights records. But the group's judgement of China \"has no basis in fact\", said Dong Yunhu, Secretary General of the China Society for Human Rights Studies. \"This group always turns a blind eye to China's progress in human rights protection, no matter how remarkable it is,\" Dong said, saying that the group has a cold war mentality when it comes to China, which leads to serious bias in its reports. The Washington-based group blasted China for rights abuse in a wide range of fields, including the country's tightened control over the internet, press, and aid groups. \"The report is politically inspired,\" Dong said. \"In reality, China has made huge progress in human rights protection in the past year.\"\n",

Through its operations to relieve hunger around the world, WFP sees first hand how a lack of adequate food often creates situations in which women and girls are vulnerable to all forms of violence.

Not only women and girls, but entire communities,\" Sisulu added.

      "Full Text: Report on the Work of the Government (19). 2. We will strengthen employment work and the social safety net. We will continue to put expansion of employment high on the government's agenda for economic and social development. We will follow fiscal, tax and banking policies that promote employment and actively support the efforts of individuals to start their own businesses or find work for themselves. The focus of our employment work will be on finding employment for people who have been laid off and are still unemployed and those who worked at enterprises that are now bankrupt. We need to actively help zero- employment households and people who have difficulty finding employment find jobs, improve guidance and services for university graduates and promote the reform of the way discharged military personnel are assisted in returning to civilian life. We will develop harmonious labor relations, fully implement the labor contract system and protect the lawful rights and interests of workers. We will step up development of the social safety net. This year 's central government budget includes allocations totaling 201.9 billion yuan for strengthening the social safety net, an increase of 24.7 billion yuan over last year. We will continue to improve the basic old-age pension system for enterprise employees and proceed with the expansion of trials to fully fund personal old- age pension accounts. We will improve the system of basic medical insurance and the system of unemployment, workers' compensation, and pregnancy and maternity insurance for urban workers. We will accelerate the establishment of a social safety net targeted at rural migrant workers in cities, with the focus on signing them up for workers' compensation insurance and medical insurance for major diseases. We will step up efforts to formulate methods for transferring social security accounts of workers moving from one region to another. We will further expand coverage for social security, particularly coverage for people employed in the non- public sector such as those working in overseas-funded or private enterprises and urban residents with flexible employment. We will collect and build social security funds through a variety of channels. We will improve the methods for collecting and managing social security premiums to raise the collection rate. We will strengthen oversight and management of social welfare funds such as social security funds and matching fund programs for housing and strictly prevent their misuse. We will energetically develop social welfare programs. We will improve the urban and rural social welfare system. We will improve the urban basic cost of living allowance system, the urban and rural subsidized medical care system, and the assistance system for urban vagrants and beggars. We will set up a nationwide basic minimum cost of living allowance system this year for rural residents, which is another major measure in the work to resolve issues related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers and build a harmonious society. All local governments should set reasonable eligibility requirements to receive such allowances and a reasonable level for allowances based on local conditions. Areas with financial difficulties will receive appropriate assistance from the central government budget. Setting up a basic cost of living allowance system for all urban and rural residents has great and far-reaching significance for promoting social fairness and building a harmonious society. We will continue to effectively implement preferential treatment policies to appropriately resolve the practical difficulties of entitled groups. We will conscientiously do the work of preventing and mitigating disasters, providing relief for victims of disasters and helping them get back on their feet. We will support the development of charity programs. We will ensure that urban and rural residents, especially the poverty-stricken population, enjoy the benefits of public finance.  (More)\n",

      "Full Text: Report on China's central and local budgets (4). Third, smooth progress was made in reform of the mechanism for guaranteeing funding for rural compulsory education. The western region took the lead in the country in the reform to exempt all rural students receiving compulsory education from paying tuition and miscellaneous fees beginning with the spring semester of 2006. The region also provided textbooks free to students from economically disadvantaged households and granted living allowances to poor boarding students. The central government granted general subsidies for compulsory education expenses in rural primary and middle schools in the western region and launched a permanent mechanism to fund repair and rebuilding of all rural primary and secondary school buildings used for compulsory education across the country. Every province in the central region also chose one of its counties to launch the above trial reforms beginning with the fall semester of 2006. Most provinces in the eastern region also carried out similar reforms on their own initiative. The central government appropriated 15 billion yuan and local governments 21.1 billion yuan for this purpose. Some special funds were handled through the centralized treasury payment system so that they reached the schools directly. This measure reduced the burden on primary school students by an average of 140 yuan per student per school year and on junior middle school students by 180 yuan. This reform enabled us to gradually incorporate expenditures for rural compulsory education into the public finance system and shows that profound changes are taking place in the way public goods are delivered in rural areas. On the basis of this reform, we strongly supported implementation of the plan to attract exemplary teachers to work in rural schools providing compulsory education and launched a pilot project to build new schools with improved sanitation facilities in the new countryside of ten provincial-level localities. All this has helped increase momentum in the development of rural compulsory education. Fourth, the trial reform to introduce a new type of rural cooperative medical care system was carried out in more areas. Statistics indicate that the trial reform was carried out in 50.7% of the country's counties, county-level cities and city districts, involving 410 million rural participants. The central government increased assistance to participants from 10 yuan per person to 20 yuan per person in 2006 and governments at the provincial level made similar increases. The central government allocated 4.27 billion yuan to fund subsidies. This reform changed institutions and mechanisms to ease the problem of rural residents being driven into poverty or back into poverty because of medical problems. Fifth, strong support was given to agricultural production and long-term development of the countryside. Support was focused on carrying out six types of small rural projects [water-efficient irrigation, potable water supplies, road building, methane production facilities, hydroelectric plants and pasture enclosure, Tr.] to improve working and living conditions in rural areas. We promoted comprehensive agricultural development, upgraded low- and medium-yield farmland and supported industrialization of agriculture, resulting in an estimated increase of 2.91 billion kilograms in grain production capacity. The central government has decided to write off 4.486 billion yuan worth of the debt accumulated for comprehensive agricultural development within a four-year period beginning in 2006 to give farmers greater incentive to develop production. The focus of spending of the 13.7 billion yuan in poverty relief funds from the central budget was on infrastructure development in poor villages, job training for poor farm laborers looking for urban employment and industrialization of agriculture. We strongly supported efforts to promote greater application of agricultural technology, to develop professional farmer cooperatives, to train rural workers seeking nonagricultural employment in the cities, to launch the project to spread knowledge of science and technology and create a new type of farmer and the plan to help farmers and villages prosper through science, and to promote the action plan for helping farmers and counties prosper through science and technology. Sixth, strong support was given to the establishment of a mechanism for diversified funding to support agriculture. We carried out a pilot project to integrate government funding to support agriculture in 162 counties in the country to improve the performance of government funds. We actively explored various mechanisms such as projects run by the local people and subsidized by the government to increase local farmer investment. We strongly supported the development of a rural financial system. In 2006 the central government appropriated 2.931 billion yuan in inflation-proof interest subsidies for rural credit cooperatives in selected areas and extended the policy on income tax reductions and exemptions by three years to credit cooperatives in selected areas to gradually reduce their longstanding debts, help drive their future development and give more play to their role as a major force in building a new socialist countryside. All these measures promoted agricultural production, increased rural incomes and stepped up progress toward balanced development between urban and rural areas. 4. Key expenditures were guaranteed in order to accelerate the development of all social programs. We directed more government spending toward social programs to shore up weak links in social development and balance economic and social development in order to truly reflect the public nature and public welfare nature of public finance, which represent its essential character.

      "Full Text: Report on China's central and local budgets (5). First, we supported employment and reemployment work and development of the social safety net. Government spending in the country for employment and the social safety net in 2006 was 433.765 billion yuan, up 17.3% compared to the figure for 2005, representing 109.1% of the budgeted figure. Allocations from the central budget totaled 201.002 billion yuan, an increase of 22.9%. On the basis of the trials in the three northeastern provinces to fully fund individual retirement accounts for the basic pensions of workers retiring from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the trial was extended to eight more provincial-level localities. We worked to ensure appropriate linkage between the urban minimum cost of living allowance system and employment and reemployment policies. We strongly supported the development of a rural medical assistance system in the central and western regions, the pilot program to provide medical assistance to urban residents in poor areas and the work of providing food, clothing, medical care, housing, and burial expenses for childless and infirm rural residents. We conscientiously carried out a strong employment policy and improved implementation measures to help SOEs in financial straits find appropriate solutions to their longstanding problems. We worked hard to assist in solving the problems of demobilized military personnel, including those working in enterprises as cadres, to help them adjust to civilian life. It is particularly worth noting that the central government promptly appropriated relief funds amounting to 11.2 billion yuan to vigorously support relief efforts in response to serious natural disasters, complemented by funds from local governments. Second, we supported the development of education. Government spending on education in 2006 totaled 475.27 billion yuan, up 19.6% compared to the figure for 2005, representing 103.8% of the budgeted figure. The central government's contribution to this amount was 53.6 billion yuan, a year-on-year rise of 39.4%. In addition to giving priority to rural compulsory education, we also launched an initiative to build national vocational colleges as a showcase for vocational higher education and to support the efforts to build hands-on training centers for these colleges. We continued to support the implementation of the May 1998 Project to improve the quality of education in universities. We improved the system of financial assistance policies consisting of government student loans, grants and scholarships as the main forms of aid for students of colleges and secondary vocational schools from financially strapped families to help them complete their education. Third, we supported the development of public health. Budget allocations from governments at all levels for medical care and public health in 2006 reached 131.158 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 26.5%, or 110.7% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, 13.8 billion yuan was from the central budget, up 65.4%. The increased spending was mainly used to finance public health programs such as prevention and control of major communicable and endemic diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and snail fever, to help pay the medical bills of poor women having babies in hospital, to equip and staff community health centers and rural health clinics and to fund the placement of a large number of doctors to rural areas to help develop local healthcare systems. Fourth, we supported innovation in science and technology. In 2006 we set up a system for ensuring stable growth of government funding for science and technology, and central and local governments spent 126.038 billion yuan on science and technology, a year-on-year rise of 26.2%, or 110.2% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, allocations from the central budget totaled 77.4 billion yuan, up 29.2%. We further improved the structure of this funding by increasing spending on basic research, on applied research, and for nonprofit research institutes. We encouraged independent innovation in enterprises by creating a system of incentives and by adopting preferential fiscal and tax policies toward innovative enterprises such as granting tax breaks and awarding government procurement contracts. Fifth, we supported the development of public cultural programs as well as the culture industry. Expenditures of governments at all levels on culture, sports and radio in 2006 amounted to 83.453 billion yuan, 18.6% more than the previous year, or 108.5% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, allocations from the central government totaled 12.3 billion yuan, up 23.9%. These expenditures were mainly used to proceed with the reform of the cultural management system and also improve the system of public cultural services. The focus of this spending was on funding efforts to extend radio and TV coverage to every village, to bring digital film projection to the countryside, to share cultural information across the country, to reward and assist some rural families that observe the family planning policy and to carry out the \"fewer children equals faster prosperity\" project in the western region.\n",

      "Full Text: China's economic and social development plan (6). Third, the need to save energy and reduce pollution is extremely pressing as pressures on resources and the environment continue to grow. Targets for energy saving and pollution reduction set at the beginning of 2006 were not met. The main reasons for this were as follows. Progress in adjustment of the industrial structure has been too slow, with the service sector of the economy still too small and continued excessively rapid growth in heavy industry, especially in certain industries that are high in energy consumption and cause serious pollution, added to the fact that many backward production facilities that should have been shut down are still in operation. Furthermore, related laws, regulations, standards, and management systems need to be improved and better coordinated, investment in projects to save energy and reduce pollution is inadequate, and fiscal, tax, pricing, financial and other policy measures to support such efforts have not been put in place. Few enterprises are motivated to upgrade their technologies to save energy and cut pollutant emission, and it will take some time before energy-saving and environmental protection projects are completed and produce results. The relevant laws and regulations are not being strictly enforced and the cost of breaking the law is too low, resulting in a great deal of wasting of resources and environmental damage in violation of laws and regulations in spite of repeated attempts to curb such behavior. People's awareness of the importance of saving energy and protecting the environment and the urgency of doing so still needs to be raised and practices persist that show too much value placed on economic growth at the cost of environmental protection in some regions. All the above means that the government's work to achieve targets set for 2007 will be daunting. Pressure on shortages of coal, electricity, petroleum and transportation is still evident from time to time in some regions and sectors, despite the fact that supplies actually increased in 2006. Fourth, social problems are still serious, and promoting social harmony remains a challenging task. The employment situation, for one, remains serious. The problems of a surplus workforce and shortages of workers in certain occupations exist simultaneously. It is growing increasingly difficult to guarantee employment for new university graduates and to find new employment for laid-off workers, especially for those who are members of zero- employment families and men over 50 and women over 40. The social security coverage is inadequate. Strong public concern has been voiced over the lack of accessibility and affordability of medical treatment and education. There are also serious problems related to food and drug safety, housing, income distribution, public security and production safety. Other problems that have a negative impact on the interests of the people include enterprise restructuring, housing demolition and resident relocation in urban areas, land acquisition and expropriation and environmental protection. Poverty alleviation in old revolutionary areas, ethnic minority regions, border areas and poverty-stricken areas is still an arduous task. We must take vigorous measures and work hard to solve the above problems. II. General Requirements and Major Targets for Economic and Social Development in 2007 In carrying out economic and social development work for 2007, we must take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide, closely follow the guiding principles set out at the Sixteenth CPC National Congress and the third through sixth plenary sessions of the Sixteenth Party Central Committee, fully put into practice the Scientific Outlook on Development and accelerate the building of a harmonious socialist society. We must continue to improve macroeconomic regulation and work hard on economic restructuring and changing the pattern of economic growth, strengthen efforts to conserve resources and protect the environment, deepen reform and opening up and promote independent innovation, promote social development and address problems affecting people's well-being, make economic and social development more scientific and promote sound and rapid development of the national economy to create an excellent environment for the convening of the Seventeenth National Congress of the CPC. In accordance with the general aims cited above and in the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan and taking into consideration both necessity and feasibility, we set the major targets for economic and social development in 2007 as follows. --An appropriate rate of economic growth based on economic restructuring, improved economic performance and reduced energy consumption and pollutant emission. We will increase the proportion of tertiary and high-tech industries in the overall economy. Government revenue for the year will total 4.4065 trillion yuan, with GDP increasing by about 8%. GDP growth has hovered around 10% or slightly higher in recent years. We are leaving some leeway in this year's targets for economic growth to indicate to society the government's intentions in terms of macroeconomic regulation and to guide all sectors of the economy to focus on improving economic structure, changing the pattern of economic growth and improving overall quality and performance. We also hope to prevent people from single-mindedly competing for the fastest economic growth and thereby promote sound and rapid economic growth. The economic growth targets are indicators of the anticipated levels and are for guidance only. Local governments should set targets for local GDP growth at an appropriate level in line with local conditions. (More)\n",

The Nigerian government has allocated 15 billion naira (about 116 million U.S. dollars) appropriation under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) debt relief for the agricultural sector, an official said here on Tuesday. Amina Ibrahim, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on MDGs, said the amount was to supplement the 20 billion naira (about 154 million dollars) allocated last year. Ibrahim said attention was focused on agriculture because it was a critical sector for the achievement of the MDGs aimed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. \"MDGs are relevant to Nigeria because one in every four Africans is a Nigerian and the poor human development index of Nigeria makes the achievement of the MDGs a compelling and urgent reality,\" she added.\n",

Putting an end to child labor in agriculture must become a political priority, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Tuesday on the occasion of the UN World Day Against Child Labor. \"It is simply unacceptable that every day 132 million children 5-14 years of age are forced to work the land, often in unhealthy and hazardous conditions,\" said Jose Maria Sumpsi, FAO Assistant Director-General for Agriculture and Consumer Protection. \"The true winning strategy against child labor is to reduce poverty in rural areas of the developing world, offering income opportunities, addressing health and safety in agriculture, improving pesticide management, and ensuring sustainable development,\" Sumpsi added. Quantifying with certainty the exact number of girls and boys working in agriculture is difficult, since child labor is often clandestine and goes unreported in official statistics. A conservative estimate by the International Labor Organization (ILO) states that child labor involves an estimated 218 million children worldwide -- 70 percent of them in agriculture. That amounts to one third of the total work force in that sector. Most studies point to the same root cause of child labor: poverty. Children are obliged to work both for their own survival and for that of their families. Poverty means also a lack of education, poor health services, limited alternative employment opportunities -- all contribute to the problem of child labor.\n",

With the vision of strengthening mechanisms for promotion and protection of human rights and the delivery of \"Justice for all\" in Bangladesh, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has initiated a new technical assistance project here with the Bangladeshi government. The project, called \"Promoting Access to Justice and Human Rights in Bangladesh\" initially aims to mobilize 3 million U.S. dollars as an integral part of cooperation between the Bangladeshi government and UNDP, said a press release issued by the UNDP's office in Bangladesh on Sunday. The cooperation will focus on such areas as democratic governance, human rights and access to justice, which particularly aims to strengthen the ability of the poor and other disadvantaged persons to demand and obtain justice by asserting human rights and statutory entitlements. The project, therefore, aims to institutionalize human rights principles and standards, through the establishment of a national human rights commission, and advance prospects for access to justice for the weakest victims of injustice, through strategic interventions involving the judiciary, law officers, the legal profession, and civil society organizations responsive to the voices of the poor. In doing so, the project will provide support to processes initiated by the government to establish a human rights commission, separate judiciary from executive, and it will focus on issues relating to capacity development of the judiciary, law officers, legal profession, legal aid authority, and civil society groups working on human rights and access to justice.\n",

High-level policymakers, development experts, and civil society members from across Asia and the world Thursday called for new approaches and actions to reduce poverty and hunger in rural Asia at an international forum held in Manila. The two-day policy forum was organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute and Asian Development Bank (ADB), with its focus on the theme of \"Agricultural and Rural Development for Reducing Poverty and Hunger in Asia: In Pursuit of Inclusive and Sustainable Growth.\" Attendants of the forum said that despite unprecedented economic growth and poverty reduction achieved during the past three decades, hunger and poverty still persist across Asia, with an estimated 600 million people in the region living on less than one U.S. dollar a day, and mostly in rural areas. \"Ironically, East Asia's remarkable economic growth, which built upon strong agricultural gains, is now contributing to expanding income inequalities between those living in cities and those in rural areas. This growing gap is not economically or politically sustainable over time. Inclusive growth is a must and inclusive growth requires rural development,\" said ADB Vice President C. Lawrence Greenwood. ADB said that by 2015,  Asia will still be home to half of the world's poor and best projections indicate that three-quarters of these poor will live in rural areas.\n",

Their proposals regarding these issues put forward to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have been highly valued, and many of them been accepted. The local branches of all the democratic parties have also conducted investigations and research into local economic and social development issues; some places have adopted the effective working method in which \"the CPC committee commissions the democratic parties to conduct surveys on certain topics and make proposals; if the proposals are adopted by the government, the related departments will fulfill them.\" In this way, the role of the democratic parties as policy and intelligence consultants has been efficiently brought into play. -- Carrying out the work of poverty alleviation and promoting public welfare undertakings.

      "Lao calls on more ADF support to Asia-Pacific development. Lao government has expressed hope the Asian Development Fund (ADF) will provide growing support to the Asia-Pacific region to help it achieve poverty eradication and development, Lao newspaper Vientiane Times said on Tuesday. The ADF assistance had contributed to the rapid economic growth and poverty reduction experienced in the region, said Lao Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh at the 2nd ADF Ten Donors' Meeting held in Vientiane on Monday. He also appreciated the role of ADF assistance in the socio-economic development of Laos, saying that the fund has helped transform the country's centrally planned economy into a market economy in a relatively short period. The ADF, with the major donor of the Asian Development Bank, has helped Laos build reasonably well-functioning urban centers, and established infrastructure and public services. The fund has also helped in strengthening governance, public financial management and capacity building, and established the legal framework which is fundament for sound governance and public resource management, said the prime minister. As a result, the poverty rate in Laos declined to 33.5 percent in 2003 from 48 percent in 1990, opium cultivation was eradicated in 2006, and the practice of shifting cultivation, which has negatively affected the environment, declined to 14,400 hectares in 2007 from 119,000 hectares in 2001. Tourism has been broadly promoted, attracting about 1.2 million visitors to Laos in 2006 and about 1.15 million during the past nine months of 2007, an increase of 32 percent compared to the same period in 2006. However, Laos and other poor developing countries still face many challenges and constraints, owing to geographical handicaps, weak human and institutional capacities, and under-developed economic and social infrastructure, said the prime minister.\n",

A report issued by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here on Thursday is cautiously optimistic on Asia's water in the future, saying that with existing knowledge, experience and technology, the region's water problems are solvable. The report, entitled \"Asian Water Development Outlook 2007\", also urged that accelerated research is needed if serious water- related stresses are to be avoided, as climate change is creating a new level of uncertainty in water planning and management processes. It also calls on governments in Asia to review their policies on water and energy in order to secure their water supplies, and to address the inherent relationships between water and other development-related sectors, such as urbanization. The report predicted that if some Asian countries face a crisis in the future, it will not be because of the scarcity of water, but because of inadequate or inappropriate water governance. It also pointed out that limited access to water is a key determinant of poverty. Yet the poor causes a significant proportion of water problems and uncontrolled deforestation. Investing in poverty reduction counters further degradation of water resources and the environment.\n",

      "Roundup: World facing daunting task to realize anti-poverty goals. Halfway through a process initiated by world leaders in 2000, the world is still facing a daunting task in its way to realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a set of eight goals that all U.N. member states have agreed to try to achieve by the year 2015. Seven years ago, world leaders at the U.N. Millennium Summit launched the MDGs, which include halving the number of people suffering from poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality, increasing access to education and health resources and improving environmental sustainability. Since then, as a series of recent reports released by the United Nations and other international organizations showed, the collective record so far has been mixed. Despite some gains in cutting extreme poverty, progress toward achieving the benchmarks on development and health care targets was poor at a time when the world reached 2007, the midpoint between the adoption of the MDGs and the 2015 target date. Overall, the world has made headway in reducing extreme poverty. Worldwide, the number of people in developing countries living on less than 1 U.S. dollar a day fell to 980 million in 2004 -- down from 1.25 billion in 1990 and the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from nearly a third to 19 percent over this period, according to U.N. figures.\n",

The equivalent of a third of the world's population has already been affected by weather- related disasters and this is set to soar because of climate change unless urgent international action is taken, according to a report issued here this week. Governments must commit at least 50 billion U.S. dollars every year to helping the world's most vulnerable communities prepare to save their own lives and livelihoods, says the report \"Climate of Disaster\" published by Tearfund, one of the UK's leading relief and development agencies. In the past 10 years, weather-related disasters have killed over 443,000 people, affected 2.5 billion people and cost an estimated 600 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses. With climate change increasing the number and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts, more and more people are becoming vulnerable to a range of environmental disasters, according to the report. Without urgent action, this trend is set to rise, leading to unprecedented levels of suffering and deaths. Poor people will be hit hardest as they are the least able to cope, and live in the most vulnerable areas of the world.

It is in line with the economic development and social progress of China, and provides legal safeguards for scientific, harmonious and peaceful development of the country. China's socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics is open and developing. As China is at a stage of social transformation, its legal system is phased and forward-looking.

Legal Systems of Respecting and Safeguarding Human Rights China takes as its constant goal the elimination of poverty, enjoyment of human rights to the full by everyone and building of a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious modern socialist country. China's basic stand on the development of human rights is: placing top priority on people's rights to subsistence and development, making development the principal task, and promoting citizens' political, economic, social and cultural rights to achieve their all-round development. Based on its Constitution, China has formulated and improved a series of legal systems to codify and institutionalize the safeguarding of human rights. - Legal safeguard of the right to life. China attaches great importance to safeguarding its citizens' right to life. The Constitution, Criminal Law and General Principles of the Civil Law all include fundamental stipulations on protecting citizens' right to life. The Production Safety Law, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Occupational Diseases, and other laws and regulations lay down provisions for the protection of working people's life and health. In view of the country's situation, China retains the death penalty in the law, but upholds the policy of \"killing fewer and with caution\" and exercises strict and cautious control over the use of the death penalty to ensure that it is applied only in the most serious cases. The death penalty shall not be imposed on persons who have not reached the age of 18 at the time the crime is committed or on women who are pregnant at the time of adjudication. The Criminal Law also prescribes the system of a two-year probation of execution, which is conducive to rigorously controlling the death penalty and reducing the actual number being executed.\n",

She said the program integrates agricultural research and development, and seeks to help poor corn farmers grow multiple crops and livestock to boost their income. The program, which was first piloted in Cebu in 1994 and has since expanded to Negros Oriental, Leyte, Occidental Mindoro and Compostela Valley in central and southern Philippines, has raised the poor farmers' income by more than 100 percent, given them more than enough corn for food with a surplus for sale and enabled them to produce vegetables, fruits and livestock, said Arroyo.

We also supported the building of a system of industrial technologies for modern agriculture, the establishment of a national platform to develop basic conditions for science and technology, and the creation of national laboratories and national key laboratories. We promoted reform of the system for managing research institutes. We encouraged independent innovation in small and medium-sized science and technology enterprises, launched a pilot project for venture capital investment, and formulated and implemented taxation policies to support the development of state university science parks and science and technology business incubators. 3. We gave more support for the building of a new socialist countryside. Funding for agricultural subsidies increased substantially. The central government spent 27.6 billion yuan, an increase of 130%, to provide farmers with general direct subsidies for buying agricultural production supplies. It also spent two billion yuan in subsidies for purchasing agricultural machinery and tools, up 233.3%, and 6.66 billion yuan in subsidies for growing superior grain varieties, up 60.5%. Direct subsidies to grain growers nationwide came to 15.1 billion yuan, and in 13 major grain- producing provinces and autonomous regions these subsidies accounted for more than 50% of those areas' grain risk funds. The government set price floors for the purchase of grain and bought 28.95 billion kilograms of wheat. The central government allocated 10.53 billion yuan to support the production of hogs, dairy products and oilseeds and ensure that supplies were adequate to meet demand. We carried out trials to subsidize insurance premiums for essential crops such as rice and wheat in six provinces and autonomous regions. We also supported programs to train 3.5 million rural workers for nonagricultural employment as well as scientific and technological training programs in 20,000 villages to foster a new type of farmer. Rural working and living conditions were improved. The central government spent 19.46 billion yuan to continue funding the construction of six categories of small rural projects [water- efficient irrigation, potable water supplies, road building, methane production facilities, hydroelectric plants, and pasture enclosure, Tr.] and another 4.2 billion yuan to build small water conservancy facilities and renovate small, dilapidated reservoirs. A total of 11.57 billion yuan was spent to promote overall development of agriculture, resulting in 1.57 million hectares of low- and medium-yield farmland being upgraded and high-grade arable land being cultivated, and in three billion kilograms of grain production capacity being added last year. Part of this sum also went to 1,457 projects to make agricultural operations more industrial. An additional 17.2 billion yuan paid out to the central government in compensation for land converted to development purposes was used to develop and protect primary farmland, improve land and cultivate arable land. One billion yuan was appropriated to promote the development of farmers' specialized cooperatives and the dissemination of agricultural science and technology. In addition, 1.29 billion yuan was spent to improve the distribution of goods and develop the market system in the countryside. Support was given to fight natural disasters, provide disaster relief and reduce poverty through development. In response to serious natural disasters in 2007, the central government promptly appropriated 13.3 billion yuan for disaster relief, supplemented by generous appropriations from local governments. To intensify poverty reduction through development, the central government spent 14.4 billion yuan mainly in poor areas in the central and western regions.

It should be pointed out here that expenditures supporting agriculture, rural areas and farmers do not constitute a single budgetary item. In order to make it easier for you to examine and deliberate expenditures in this area, we have combined all expenditure items related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers so there will be some overlap with expenditures for education, medical and health care, etc. 4.

Spending of the central government on education totaled 107.635 billion yuan, an increase of 76%. A total of 36.48 billion yuan from the central budget, along with 32.3 billion yuan from local budgets, was spent to fully carry out the reform to introduce a system for guaranteeing funding for rural compulsory education, exempt all the students receiving compulsory education in rural areas across the country from paying tuition and miscellaneous education fees, provide them with free textbooks, give living allowances to students from poor families who stay in school dormitories, raise budgetary funding for operating expenses of primary and secondary schools and increase subsidies for renovating their buildings. All this benefited 150 million students receiving compulsory education in rural areas and 7.8 million students from poor families living on campus. We supported the trials to provide free education to education students at normal universities directly under the Ministry of Education. A new policy system for providing financial assistance to students from poor families was adopted to cover more students and raise the amount of aid they receive. We also gave financial support to students from poor families at regular undergraduate institutions, and vocational colleges and secondary vocational schools in the form of grants. We stimulated the development of medical and health care. Central government expenditures for medical and health care reached 66.431 billion yuan, a rise of 296.8%. The new type of rural cooperative medical care was extended to reach 730 million rural residents in 86% of the country's counties, and the central government provided 11.4 billion yuan in subsidies for this program. We began trials to implement a basic medical insurance system for urban residents in selected cities, with annual subsidies of at least 40 yuan per person from the central government. A total of 3.4 billion yuan was spent to further carry out the work of providing medical care for needy urban and rural residents. Spending on public health increased, with 9.68 billion yuan used primarily to support prevention and control of major diseases and development of community-based health services. We supported social safety net, employment and other work. The central government spent 230.316 billion yuan on the social safety net and employment effort, an increase of 13.7%. To put in place a system of cost of living allowances for rural residents throughout the country, the central government paid out three billion yuan in subsidies to areas with financial difficulties and local governments also increased their spending. It spent 16 billion yuan to support improvements in the system of cost of living allowances for urban residents. It allocated 6.5 billion yuan in subsidies to raise the basic pension benefits for retired enterprise employees. It also granted 1.7 billion yuan in subsidies to increase the allowances for entitled groups and allowed more people to become eligible for these allowances, benefiting over six million people. Subsidies were granted to urban recipients of cost of living allowances as well as junior college and secondary technical school students from poor families who were materially affected by the rises in the prices of pork and other foods. A total of 15 billion yuan was granted in subsidies to industries and groups such as fisheries and taxi drivers that were greatly affected by the increases in the prices of refined oil products. A total of 5.11 billion yuan was allocated to relieve enterprises of their obligation to operate social programs. Twenty billion yuan was spent to subsidize the policy-based closures or bankruptcies of 92 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to find new employment for 357,000 of their laid-off employees. Another ten billion yuan in subsidies was allocated to pay long-overdue salaries and wages owed to SOE employees. The central government spent 13.7 billion yuan to provide further aid to residents displaced by large and medium- sized reservoirs. The central government paid out 23.8 billion yuan in subsidies to increase support for employment and reemployment efforts, and it further improved the preferential taxation policy for employment of the jobless, people with physical or mental disabilities, and other special groups.

      "Full Text: Report on China's central, local budgets (11). 2. We will consolidate and strengthen all fiscal and taxation policies designed to support and help agriculture, rural areas and farmers. We are continuing to make support for agriculture, rural areas and farmers the focus of our budgetary arrangements and fiscal work. Particular attention will be given to strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy, promoting its development, increasing rural incomes and making real progress in developing a new socialist countryside. Expenditures in the central budget for agriculture, rural areas and farmers total 562.5 billion yuan, an increase of 130.7 billion yuan or 30.3%. We will increase subsidies for farmers. Expenditures in the central budget for subsidies to farmers total 133.59 billion yuan, an increase of 25.3 billion yuan or 23.4%. Included in this figure is 15.1 billion yuan in direct subsidies to grain producers, 48.2 billion yuan in general direct subsidies for agricultural supplies, 4 billion yuan in subsidies for the purchase of agricultural equipment and machinery, 7.07 billion yuan in subsidies for superior seed varieties, and 1.6 billion yuan in subsidies for training farmers. We will strongly support the development of agricultural production. Expenditures in the central budget for the support of agricultural production total 304.45 billion yuan (including most of the expenditures for agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, expenditures for farmland reforestation projects that are listed in the environmental protection section of the budget, and subsidies for reform of rural taxes and fees that are listed in the section of the budget dealing with fiscal transfer payments from the central to local governments), an increase of 44.19 billion yuan or 17%. This figure includes: 102.28 billion yuan to develop rural infrastructure; 8.4 billion yuan to finance the building of small farm water conservancy facilities and repair small reservoirs in poor condition; 12.72 billion yuan to finance overall agricultural development, which will focus on supporting efforts to improve low- and medium- yield farmland in major grain-producing regions and reduce water use in medium- sized irrigated areas in order to enhance overall agricultural production capacity; 16.5 billion yuan to stabilize and improve the reward policies for major grain-producing counties; 13.5 billion yuan to improve the follow-up policies on farmland reforestation, continue paying subsidies to farmers displaced by farmland reforestation and strengthen the development of basic subsistence farmland for them; 6.05 billion yuan to improve the system of subsidies for agricultural insurance premiums; and 16.73 billion yuan to increase funding to alleviate poverty through development and make innovations in poverty relief mechanisms. We will increase support for wider application of advanced and appropriate agricultural technologies. In addition, we will improve fiscal and taxation policies and measures to stimulate greater production of pork, dairy products and oilseeds. We will set a floor price for the purchase of grain and appropriately increase the floor price for the purchase of grain and wheat when needed. We will accelerate development of rural social programs. The central government has allocated 124.52 billion yuan for this purpose, an increase of 61.14 billion yuan or 96.5%. This sum is made up of: 107.32 billion yuan to support rural education, culture and public health; 9 billion yuan to fully set up and optimize a system of cost of living allowances for rural residents; and 6.2 billion yuan to help people affected by natural disasters to restore their lives.\n",

      "Full Text: China's economic, social development plan (8). II. Overall Requirements and Major Objectives for Economic and Social Development in 2008 In pursuing economic and social development in 2008, we must fully implement the guidelines adopted at the Seventeenth Party Congress, hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide and thoroughly apply the Scientific Outlook on Development. We will focus our efforts on transforming the pattern of economic development and improving the socialist market economy. We will continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation, work vigorously to advance reform and opening up and strengthen the country's capacity for independent innovation, and work hard to improve the economic structure and quality of economic growth. We must intensify efforts to save energy, reduce emissions and protect the environment. More attention will be paid to enhancing people's wellbeing and promoting social harmony as we strive for sound and fast economic development. In view of the above requirements and what is needed versus what is possible, and in conformity with the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, we have set the following major objectives for economic and social development in 2008: - Raising the quality of economic growth. We need to further improve the economic structure, accelerate the development of tertiary industry, increase the contribution of high-tech industries to the economy and increase R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP to 1.6%. Energy consumption per unit of GDP, sulfur dioxide emissions and chemical oxygen demand should fall by a larger margin than last year. Government revenue and corporate profits are expected to grow steadily. On the basis of structural improvement, improved efficiency, lower energy consumption and environmental protection measures, China's GDP is expected to grow by about 8% in 2008. A major reason for introducing the above targets for economic development is to communicate to society the government's regulatory intentions and guide all sectors to focus their work and attention on transforming the pattern of development, improving the quality of economic growth, saving energy and reducing emissions in order to achieve both sound and fast development. All local authorities should set targets for local GDP growth at an appropriate level in line with local conditions and avoid blind competition and setting targets at each administrative level that are too high. - Continuing to improve people's lives. Urban employment should expand by 10 million new jobs and the urban registered unemployment rate should stay at about 4.5%. The incomes of urban and rural residents should continue to increase fairly fast. Per capita net income of rural residents should increase by 6% or more in real terms. The new system of rural cooperative medical care should cover all rural areas and will receive more subsidies from the central and local government budgets. The number of rural people living in poverty should be reduced by 2 million or more. Fiscal guarantees to ensure adequate funding for compulsory education in rural areas will be strengthened. The program of free education for urban students taking compulsory education will be fully instituted. Natural population growth should stay within 0.7%. The major factors taken into consideration in setting the above goals are: national economic growth has been steady and fast for several years in a row, the financial strength of the country has further increased, the performance of enterprises has markedly improved and the impact of the vigorous employment policy is becoming increasingly noticeable. In addition, the implementation of policy measures to promote increase in people's incomes, especially that of farmers, and strengthen the social safety net has made it necessary and created the conditions for us to further expand employment, increase the incomes of urban and rural residents and address issues affecting people's wellbeing such as education and medical care.

African experts said here Monday that China could be a driver of regional integration of Africa and play bigger role in helping economic development of the continent. They made the remarks at a joint conference hosted by the South African Center for Chinese Studies and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) in north of Johannesburg between March 31 and April 1. The conference with the theme of \"China as a driver of regional integration in Africa: Prospects for the future\" has drawn more than 150 experts, economists, scholars, senior government officials and entrepreneurs. Dr. Snowy Khoza, executive manager of DBSA, said China has achieved great success in economic development within decades of years, and has successfully turned a poor and weak China into a global economic power. Africa hopes to draw on the experiences of China in a bid to eliminate poverty for the 900 million people of the continent. Martyn Davies, executive director of the Center for Chinese Studies of Stellenbosch University, said that China has devoted to economic development and has got rid of poverty for 500 million poor population. China's development road can be a model for the African countries.\n",

Therefore, we must concentrate on the African countries so that they can have adequate time to achieve them,\" said Yunus. \"President Nicolas Sarkozy assured Yunus that France would continue and accelerate its efforts, particularly in Africa, where it is already providing more than a third of funds devoted to the microfinance sector,\" the presidential palace said in a statement after the meeting.\n",

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has announced that the cereal import bill of the world's poorest countries is expected to shoot up by up to 56 percent in 2008 compared to the previous year, according to official sources. \"The importation of grains by the poorest countries of the world will increase by 56 percent in 2008, after a significant rise of about 37 percent that was recorded in 2007,\" the United Nations agency announced in a statement Friday. Headed by Senegal's Jacques Diouf, FAO said that for low income countries that experience habitual food deficit, the bill is expected to increase by up to 74 percent, an increase that is due to soaring international grain prices, freight charges and the prevailing oil prices. Faced with this situation, FAO has launched an initiative to combat the soaring prices, said the statement, adding that the move is designed to provide developing countries with technical assistance and policy to help vulnerable farmers to bolster production. According to FAO, the initiative has already been launched in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mozambique and Senegal, where a new aid concept is intended to prepare strategies and appropriate interventions to increase agricultural productivity in the context of existing national development programs.\n",

Vietnam's relevant agencies have told cities and provinces nationwide to effectively implement national programs on job creation, poverty reduction, lending for vocational training and labor export, local newspaper Vietnam News reported Monday. Poverty reduction efforts have focused on Vietnam's 58 poorest districts. Many people who suffered losses due to the recent long cold spell or outbreaks of animal diseases have been allowed to reschedule their payment of loans from poverty reduction funds, as well as borrow more to restore production. According to the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, 300,000 poor households, or nearly 1.2 million people, received government support in the first quarter of this year. The number of people receiving health insurance cards also rose to 15 million, with full-government subsidies going to 11 million of the total. More preferential lending has been granted to poor students and those living in mountainous and remote areas. At a government meeting last month, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said expanding social security policies was a major task for the state.

      "protection. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Wednesday that poor countries can also provide basic social protection like financing health care, cash transfers to the poor, the elderly and child protection. The ADB said in a news release that results of its newly developed Social Protection Index (SPI) shows that the ability to provide appropriate social protection to a nation's citizens is not only a question of the country's wealth. The SPI will give governments and international agencies a new tool to assess and compare the social protection efforts of countries throughout Asia and the Pacific region, said ADB. While social protection is growing in importance in the fight against poverty and in meeting the Millennium Development Goals, there have been very few attempts to systematically quantify the overall impact of social protection activities in terms of expenditure, beneficiaries or the impact of the programs, so the SPI was created to fill this void, according to ADB. \"The development community's commitment for alleviating poverty, and to assist our developing member countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region remains the priority challenge for ADB,\" said Ursula Schaefer-Preuss, ADB Vice-President of Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development.   \"This publication on the Social Protection Index provides us with an important and so far unique tool to have a better understanding of the challenges that are ahead of us,\"said Schaefer-Preuss.\n",

The journey of China's rising from poverty, as the writer Chen recalled, however, is quite bumpy, strewn with disputes, advances and retreats, successes and setbacks. In his memoir, the former director of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and later head of the State Planning Commission, the top economic planner in the 1990s, poured out his first-hand impression of the Party governance and high-profile decision-making on thorny issues, especially macro- economic control. When the retail price index surged to 18.5 percent in 1988, touching off quite serious inflation and great panic in cities, detractors said to go in for the market economy was to ditch public ownership, the Party leadership and the Socialist system for Capitalism.\n",

      "Change(2). Foreword Global climate change and its adverse effects are a common concern of mankind. Ever since the industrial revolution, human activities, especially the massive consumption of energy and resources by developed countries in the process of industrialization, have increased the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, produced conspicuous impacts on the natural ecosystems of the Earth, and posed severe challenges to the survival and development of human society. As a developing country with a large population, a relatively low level of economic development, a complex climate and a fragile eco-environment, China is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which has brought substantial threats to the natural ecosystems as well as the economic and social development of the country. These threats are particularly pressing in the fields of agriculture and livestock breeding, forestry, natural ecosystems and water resources, and in coastal and eco-fragile zones. Therefore, China's priority task at present is to adapt itself to climate change. The multiple pressures of developing the economy, eliminating poverty and mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases constitute difficulties for China in its efforts to cope with climate change, since the country is undergoing rapid economic development. A responsible developing country, China sets great store by climate change issues. Fully aware of the importance and urgency of addressing climate change, following the requirements of the Scientific Outlook on Development, and taking into overall consideration of both economic development and ecological construction, domestic situation and international situation, and present and future, China has formulated and implemented a national plan for coping with climate change, and adopted a series of policies and measures in this regard. China combines the handling of climate change with its execution of its sustainable development strategy, acceleration of building a resource-conserving and environmental-friendly society and construction of a country of innovation. Taking economic development as the core objective, and placing emphasis on energy conservation, optimization of the energy mix, reinforcement of ecological protection and construction, and scientific and technological progress as backup, China strives to control and mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases and continuously enhance the capability of adapting itself to climate change. China actively participates in worldwide efforts to address climate change, earnestly observes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, and plays a constructive role in international cooperation in this regard.

      "Rights (3). Q. As you are the head of the State Council Information Office, could you tell us the functions of your unit and what is the role the office has played in human rights? A. Our office was founded in 1991. The functions of our office can be summarized as \"letting the world know about China and making China known in the world.\" To tell the world about China includes not only explanations about China's domestic and foreign policies, China's history, culture and political, economic and social development but also revelation of the truth and China's stands and views on some major issues on which there are a lot of misunderstandings, deep biases and accusations in other countries so as to remove doubts and enhance understanding and create a good international context for China's peaceful development. The human rights issue, for instance, is an area in which the outside world has known little about China and there are many misunderstandings. So it is a very important part of the work of our office to present the fact and views of China on human rights. In the recent two decades, we have done the following work with regard to human rights: --- Expounding China's views, advocacies and practice with regard to human rights, telling the world the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese government and people in promoting human rights and the resulting achievements so as to help the international community to know more about the true human rights conditions in China. Toward the end of the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s, some international antagonistic forces, out of different ideologies and social systems, launched an anti-China wave, spearheading human rights attacks against China. To tell the world about the true human rights conditions in China and its basic stand and policies, our office issued the first white paper on human rights – Human Rights in China. After that, our office has issued seven white papers to give an account of the general situation of human rights in China. In addition, it has issued more than 30 white papers and dozens of important articles on such topics as democracy, criminals' transformation, women and children, population and family planning, poverty relief, labor and social security, ethnic minorities and religion, and the rule of law, all of which are closely associated with human rights and are of international concern. These white papers and articles have given a complete and systematic picture of the human rights conditions in China, summed up its basic experience in human rights development, completely and authoritatively expounded the basic views of the Chinese government on human rights issues. They have played an important role in helping the international community get a complete and true picture of China's human rights conditions, in giving the lies to the distortions and accusations by international antagonistic forces and in clearing up the misunderstanding about China's human rights. These documents have won favorable comments from the international opinion. It is generally believed that China's active stance to clear about issues concerning human rights by way of issuing white papers has \"increased the openness and transparency of the government,\" \"enhanced the understanding of the international community on China's human rights conditions and made the international community see the progress China has made in human rights and know the endeavors made by the Chinese government toward improvement of human rights.\" --- Refuting unfounded accusations against China's human rights conditions by the US Department of State in its \"Country Report on Human Rights\" and safeguarding China's state sovereignty and national dignity. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the US Department of State, in collaboration with some other Western countries, has been repeatedly mooted anti-China bills in the UN Human Rights Commission and issued its annual \"Country Report on Human Rights\" to distort and accuse China of its human rights conditions. Starting from 1994, our office has issued more than 10 weighty commentaries against the attacks by the US Department of State in its \"Country Report on Human Rights\" by presenting solid facts to lay bare the true intentions of the United States in carrying out its anti-China and anti-Communist and hegemonic strategies on the pretext of human rights. These commentaries have caused strong favorable reactions from the international community. From 2000 to the present, in countering the distortion and accusation by the United States by way of paying back in its own coin, so to speak, we have issued the Human Rights Record of the United States for eight years running, using a lot of data and facts to expose the bad human rights records of the United States and its double standards on human rights. The move has been extensively echoed in the world. Some foreign media described these articles as \"like a sharp sword, pointing directly at the tender point of the United States.\" Some developing countries said that China has voiced what the developing countries wanted to say. Mass media of some developing countries appealed to their ruling authorities \"not to keep silent anymore and to learn from China to give response to the U.S. 'Country Report on Human Rights' and safeguard national dignity.\" --- Holding exhibitions to demonstrate the human rights conditions of China and its unique path concerning human rights development. In November 2006, our office and the China Society for Human Rights Studies held a \"China Human Rights Exhibition\" at the Beijing Cultural Palace of Nationalities. From July to October 2007, the two units held photo exhibitions \"Contemporary Chinese Life through the Lens\" in India, Nepal, Austria, Italy, Egypt and Uzbekistan. A theme exhibition \"Chinese People's Life through the Lens\" was also held at the Beijing Cultural Palace of Nationalities during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The \"China's Human Rights Exhibition\" was the first of its kind in the world. It exhibited more than 700 photos and more than 250 objects, more than 1,000 titles of books on human rights, 24 tables and charts. These, plus situational models, video and film shows, electronic calendars, electronic white papers, internet interaction, touch- screen Q&A and on-the-spot demonstration of folk arts, have visualized and specified the abstract concept of human rights and artistically reproduced the glorious course traversed by the Chinese people in fighting for, safeguarding and developing human rights and the great achievements they have scored. They have also systematically displayed the policies and laws of China in protecting human rights, giving a complete picture of China's human rights conditions and progress at all levels, from all perspectives and in all aspects. They served as an important information platform for Chinese and foreign visitors to get an objective and complete picture of China's human rights. Many foreign media described the exhibition as \"having reflected the progress and openness of China\" and \"very useful for the international community to know about China's human rights.\"\n",

      "Rights (5). Q. Great changes have taken place in the present-day international human rights. How do you view the present situation in this field? How do you think the world human rights cause can develop healthily? A. There are two prominent features in the current international human rights situation. One is that the international community has never attached such great importance to human rights as at present and human rights have become an important subject in international exchange and cooperation. Since the end of the Cold War, human rights issues have become increasingly important in international relations and international politics. With the rapid growth of economic globalization and informationization of social life, countries have become increasingly inter-dependent and mutually cooperative, thus accentuating the importance of human rights issues. Countries have attached more and more importance to human rights issues and reached more and more common understanding on these issues. In March 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, deciding to set up the Human Rights Council under it to replace the Human Rights Commission affiliated to the UN Economic and Social Council. This shows that human rights have for the first time been juxtaposed with security and development as the \"three main pillars\" of the UN. In recent years, some countries have, according to the UN requirements, set up national human rights organizations such as national human rights commissions, thus putting the promotion and protection of human rights in a more important position. The second is that it has become a common call to have dialogue and oppose confrontation, making those who use human rights to create confrontation be more and more unpopular. All this represents progress and development in the area of international human rights. However, what cannot be ignored is that there are still factors of disharmony in the development of world human rights and there are still stiff challenges. For instance, as the new international political and economic order has not been established and the world economic development is still very uneven, and the South-North gaps continue to grow, the rights to survival and development of the people of developing countries are being seriously threatened. Some countries and regional groups have politicized and ideologized human rights by practicing double standards, flying the \"human rights\" flag to negate the sovereignty of other countries and carry out hegemonism and power politics, thus seriously spoiling the atmosphere of international cooperation in and obstructing the healthy development of human rights in the world. I think that to seek healthy development of human rights in the world, we must, first of all, face up to the prominent problems in the present-day world and rise up to safeguard the rights to survival and development of the people of all countries. At present, armed conflicts and other traditional security problems still exist; non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and environmental pollution have become more and more prominent, seriously threatening the innocent lives of millions of people. The South-North and poor-rich gaps have been further enlarged, with the developed countries with a population of less than 20 percent of the world's total controlling more than 85 percent of the global wealth while developing countries with more than 80 percent of the world's population enjoying less than 15 percent of the wealth of the world. There are more than one billion people in developing countries who are still suffering from poverty, hunger and diseases. Their survival and dignity have been seriously threatened. Only by rooting out the factors that seriously threaten and sabotage human rights, can the rights of the people of all countries be realized. Secondly, it is imperative to integrate the universality of human rights with the national conditions of various countries. All people of all countries should enjoy freedom and equality. This is the universal pursuit and common ideal of mankind. But, restrained by economic development level, cultural traditions and social systems, people have different understandings and demands with regard to human rights and their human rights problems that need priority solution also vary. Under the precondition of recognizing the universality of human rights, all governments and people have the right to adopt different policy measures and ways and means according to their respective national conditions to seek models and paths for human rights development best suited to their national conditions. The diversification of human rights development models not only fully reflects the diversity of civilizations and the wisdom and intelligence of the people of all countries, but also enriches and develops the human rights theories and practice in the world. Respect for the diversity of the human rights development models not only means respect for the national conditions of all countries, the wisdom and creativity of their people, the diversity of civilizations and ways of living, but also constitutes the important precondition for human rights development in the world.\n",

For centuries, the Tibetan people had been living in dire misery and suffering from the harshness of life, and their society had sunk into a grave state of poverty, backwardness, isolation and decline, verging on total collapse. -- Medieval theocratic society. British military journalist Edmund Candler, who visited Lhasa in 1904, recorded the details of the old Tibetan society in his book \"The Unveiling of Lhasa\": \"... at present, the people are medieval, not only in their system of government and their religion, their inquisition, their witchcraft, their incarnations, their ordeals by fire and boiling oil, but in every aspect of their daily life.\" (The Unveiling of Lhasa, Edmund Candler. London: Pentagon, 2007)  The most distinctive feature of the social system of old Tibet was theocracy, a system which ensured that the upper religious strata and the monasteries were together the political power holders as well as the biggest serf owners, possessing all kinds of political and economic privileges, and manipulating the material and cultural lives of the Tibetan people at their own advantage. Candler wrote in the book: \"The country is governed on the feudal system. The monks are the overlords, the peasantry their serfs.\" \"Powerful lamas controlled everything in Tibet, where even the Buddha himself couldn't do anything without the support of the lamas,\" he added. (The Unveiling of Lhasa, Edmund Candler. London: Pentagon, 2007)  Statistics show that before the democratic reform in 1959, Tibet had 2,676 monasteries and 114,925 monks, including 500 senior and junior Living Buddhas and other upper-ranking lamas, and over 4,000 lamas holding substantial economic resources. About one quarter of Tibetan men were monks. The three major monasteries -- Drepung, Sera and Ganden -- housed a total of more than 16,000 monks, and possessed 321 manors, 147,000 mu (15 mu equal one hectare, it is locally called ke in Tibet -- ed.) of land, 450 pastures, 110,000 head of livestock, and over 60,000 serfs. The vicious expansion of religious power under theocracy depleted massive human resources and most material resources, shackled people's thinking and impeded the development of productivity. Charles Bell, who lived in Lhasa as a British trade representative in the 1920s, described in his book \"Portrait of A Dalai Lama: The Life and Times of the Great Thirteenth\" that the theocratic position of the Dalai Lama enabled him to administer rewards and punishments as he wished, because he held absolute power over both this life and the next of the serfs, and coerced them with such power.(Portrait of A Dalai Lama: The Life and Times of the Great Thirteenth, Charles Bell, London: Collins, 1946)  American Tibetologist Melvyn C. Goldstein incisively pointed out that Tibetan society and government were built upon a value system dominated by religious goals and behavior. Religious power and privileges, and the leading monasteries \"played a major role in thwarting progress\" in Tibet. Religion and the monasteries \"were heavy fetters upon Tibet's social progress\". \"This commitment... to the universality of religion as the core metaphor of Tibetan national identity will be seen... to be a major factor underlying Tibet's inability to adapt to changing circumstances.\" (A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State, Melvyn C. Goldstein. California: University of California, 1991) -- Means of production mostly monopolized by the three major estate-holders. The three major estate-holders, that is, local administrative officials, aristocrats and upper-ranking lamas in the monasteries, and their agents, accounted for less than five percent of Tibet's population, but owned all of Tibet's farmland, pastures, forests, mountains, rivers and beaches, as well as most livestock. About 90 percent of old Tibet's population was made up of serfs, called \"tralpa\" in Tibetan (namely, people who tilled plots of land assigned to them and had to provide corvee labor for the serf owners) and \"duiqoin\" (small households with chimneys emitting smoke). They had no means of production or per- sonal freedom, and the survival of each of them depended on tilling plots for the estate- holders. In addition, \"nangzan,\" who comprised five percent of the population, were hereditary slaves, known as \"speaking tools.\" Statistics released in the early years of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century indicate that Tibet then had more than three million mu of farmland, of which 30.9 percent was owned by the local feudal government, 29.6 percent by aristocrats, and 39.5 percent by monasteries and upper-ranking lamas. The three major estate-holders' monopoly of the means of production remained unchanged until the democratic reform in 1959. Before 1959, the family of the 14th Dalai Lama possessed 27 manors, 30 pastures and over 6,000 serfs, and annually squeezed about 33,000 ke (one ke equals 14 kilograms -- ed.) of qingke (highland barley), 2,500 ke of butter, two million liang (15 liang of silver equal one silver dollar of the time) of Tibetan silver, 300 head of cattle, and 175 rolls of pulu (woolen fabric made in Tibet) out of its serfs. In 1959, the Dalai Lama alone owned 160,000 liang of gold, 95 million liang of silver, over 20,000 pieces of jewelry and jadeware, and more than 10,000 pieces of silk and satin fabric and rare fur clothing, including over 100 robes inlaid with pearls and gems, each worth tens of thousands of yuan.

A Russian traveler in Lhasa in the early 20th century, wrote in his book \"A Buddhist Pilgrim to the Holy Place of Tibet\": \"The offenders are mostly poverty- stricken Tibetans punished either by having their fingers or noses cut off, or, in most cases, by being blinded in both eyes. Such disfigured and blind people are seen begging in the streets of Lhasa every day. Exile is another type of punishment. Offenders are shackled and chained, and have to wear a large round wooden collar around their necks all their life. They are sent to remote regions for hard labor or work as serfs for feudal aristocrats and patriarchal chiefs. The most severe punishment of all is, of course, the death penalty, with the victims drowned in rivers (as in Lhasa) or thrown over rocky cliffs (as in Xigaze).\" (A Buddhist Pilgrim to the Holy Place of Tibet, Gombojab Tsebekovitch Tsybikoff) David MacDonald, a Briton, wrote in his book \"The Land of the Lama\": \"Capital punishment is deemed the heaviest category of punishment in Tibet, to which the most inhuman practice of dismemberment is added based on the hypothesis proposed by Tibetan lamas that after dismemberment the human soul cannot be reincarnated. The most common practice is to throw the condemned prisoner into a river in a leather wrapper, which will sink in about five minutes. If he remains alive after this time, he will be tossed into the water again until he dies. Afterwards, the body will be dismembered, and hurled into the river to drift downward with the current... Even more appalling is the practice of gouging out a prisoner's eyes. A piece of heated, U-shaped iron is inserted into the eye sockets, or boiling water or oil is poured in, and the eyeballs are prized out with an iron hook.\" (The Land of the Lama, David MacDonald) There were penitentiaries or private jails in monasteries and aristocrats' residences, where instruments of torture were kept and clandestine tribunals held to punish serfs and slaves. In the Ganden Monastery there were many handcuffs, fetters, cudgels, and instruments of torture used for eye gouging and hamstringing. The private monastery administrative office set up by Trijang Rinpoche, junior tutor of the present 14th Dalai Lama, killed and injured more than 500 serfs and poor monks, in Dechen Dzong (present-day Dagze County) jailed 121 people, sent 89 into exile, forced 538 into slavery, forced 1,025 commoners into exile, forced 72 divorces, and 484 women were raped there. In the Archives of the Tibet Autonomous Region there is a letter from a department of the Tibet local government to Rabden in the early 1950s, saying that, to celebrate the Dalai Lama's birthday, all the staff of Gyumey would chant the sutra. To successfully complete this ceremony, some special food would be thrown to the animals. Thus, a corpus of wet intestine, two skulls, many kinds of blood and a full human skin were urgently needed, all of which must be promptly delivered. A religious ceremony for the Dalai Lama used human blood, skulls and skin, showing how cruel and bloody the feudal serfdom system under theocracy was in old Tibet. -- Heavy taxes and larvee. Serf owners exploited serfs by imposing corvee labor, taxes and levies, and rents for land and livestock. There were over 200 kinds of taxes levied by the former local government of Tibet alone. Serfs had to contribute more than 50 percent or even 70 to 80 percent of their labor, unpaid, to the government and manor owners. At feudal manors, serf owners divided the land into two parts: Most fertile land was kept as manor demesne while infertile and remote lots were rented to serfs on stringent conditions. To use the lots, serfs had to work on the demesne with their own farm implements and provide their own food. Only after they had finished work on the demesne could they work on the lots assigned to them. In the busy farming season or when serf owners needed laborers, serfs had to contribute man and animal power gratis. In addition, serfs had to do unpaid work for the local government of Tibet and its subordinate organizations, among which the heaviest was transport corvee, because Tibet is large but sparsely populated and all kinds of things had to be transported by man or animal power.\n",

      "Full Text: Fifty Years of Democratic Reform in Tibet (14). -- People's living standards have been greatly enhanced, with their subsistence and development conditions much improved. Before the democratic reform in 1959, Tibetan peasants and herdsmen had barely any means of production. Debt-ridden almost for the whole life, they hardly expected any net income. But since 1978 the per capita net income of Tibetan peasants and herdsmen kept increasing at an average rate of 10.1 percent per year, reaching 3,176 yuan in 2008. The annual growth rate in the 2003-2008 period was 13.1 percent. The per capita disposable income of urban dwellers in Tibet stood at 12,482 yuan in 2008, which was 21 times that of the 565 yuan in 1978. Before the democratic reform, more than 90 percent of Tibet's residents had no private housing, the peasants and herdsmen had very poor living conditions, and the per-capita housing of urban dwellers was less than three sq m. At that time, Lhasa had a population of 20,000 only, and nearly 1,000 were poverty-stricken or beggar households huddling in tattered shelters on the outskirts. Today, with the construction of a new countryside and the comfortable housing project underway, 200,000 households, comprising nearly one million peasants and herdsmen, have moved into modern houses. By 2008, the per-capita housing area was 22.83 sq m in rural areas and 33.00 sq m in urban areas. A social security system has been basically put in place to cover both cities and countryside in Tibet. In 2008, the allowances for each family of the infirm elderly without children, which is guaranteed food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses, was raised to 1,600 yuan. In 2006, Tibet led other farming and pastoral areas in China with a system of basic subsistence allowances which covered all peasants and herdsmen with an income below 800 yuan. Before the peaceful liberation, there was no medical institution in the modern sense in Tibet, except for three small, shabby government-run organizations of Tibetan medicine and a small number of private clinics, with fewer than 100 medical workers altogether. If the nearly 300 Tibetan medical practitioners in the farming and pastoral areas were included, the total number of medical workers would still have fallen below 400 - less than four medical workers for every 10,000 residents. Smallpox, cholera, venereal diseases, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, tetanus and other epidemics were prevalent.\n",

      "Full Text: Fifty Years of Democratic Reform in Tibet (17). Conclusion Over the past 50 years, tremendous changes have taken place in Tibet, as it has experienced a process from darkness to brightness, from poverty to prosperity, from autocratic rule to democracy, and from self-seclusion to opening up. At present, Tibet is in its best period of historical development with rapid economic and social progress, cultural prosperity, improved living conditions, national unity, good government and harmonious people. History has convincingly proved that instituting the democratic reform in this 1.2-million-sq-km land and abolishing the centuries-old feudal serfdom of theocracy to emancipate one million serfs and slaves is of great significance not only in the history of China's human rights development, but also in the world's anti-slavery history. This is a great page in the progress of human civilization that will shine throughout the ages. Without the democratic reform, there would have been no emancipation of the laborers constituting 95 percent of the Tibetan population, no frog-leaping social progress and human rights development in Tibet, and no happy life for all ethnic groups in Tibet today. History has convincingly proved that the 14th Dalai Lama and his political clique are the chief representatives of old Tibet's theocratic feudal serfdom and a small number of serf-owners who monopolized with vested interests old Tibet's political, economic and cultural resources. There are fundamental conflicts of interests between them and the Tibetan laboring people who constitute the overwhelming majority of the Tibetan population, and there are irreconcilable and profound contradictions between them and the need for social progress in Tibet as well as the rules for the development of human society. This means that the Dalai clique is destined to remain anti-democratic reform, that they will not quit the stage of history and give up their privileges by themselves, and that they will not concede defeat. Fifty years ago, the Dalai clique staged an armed rebellion, aiming to separate Tibet from the motherland so as to maintain the theocratic feudal serfdom and to preserve their privileges forever. Since fleeing overseas 50 years ago, they have never stopped trying to restore the system of theocratic feudal serfdom. With the support of anti-China forces, they set up and maintained a so-called \"Tibetan government-in-exile\" with the 14th Dalai Lama as the theocratic leader, and have never ceased their separatist activities to sabotage the steady development of Tibet. They have turned black into white in an attempt to mislead the international community, pretending to be speaking on behalf of the \"Tibetan people.\" They whitewash the old Tibetan society of feudal serfdom under theocracy as some sort of Shangri- la, denigrating the implementation of the democratic reform to promote social progress as \"destruction of culture and religion\" and \"infringement of human rights.\" This shows how they hate to see the abolition of the theocratic feudal serfdom, to see the loss of the serf-owners' privileges, how they hate to see the Tibetans and people of other ethnic groups becoming their own masters under the socialist democratic system, and leading a happy and peaceful life; and how they long to restore the feudal serfdom of theocracy that has been swept into the dustbin of history so as to regain the \"paradise\" under the rule of the feudal serf-owners. This also shows that our essential difference from and fight with the Dalai clique are not merely over the question of autonomy. This is a struggle between progress and retrogression, and between unity and separation. (more)\n",

      "Zambia vows to provide people social protection. Zambia's Community Development and Social Services Minister, Michael Kaingu has called on civil society organizations in the country to work hand in hand with his ministry to help address challenges faced by vulnerable people in the country, Zambia News and Information Services (ZANIS) reported on Wednesday. Kaingu said civil society organizations and donors should work closely with his ministry as it is strategically positioned to help reduce poverty at the grassroots level. His ministry is repositioning itself in order to deal with the current global economic crisis when many people are losing their jobs and need help. Kaingu was quoted by ZANIS as saying that the government is committed to providing social protection to its people, adding that it was because of this that this ministry was created to address the challenges the people were facing. He said the government has taken seriously the need to provide social protection to the people as seen by including social protection measures in the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP). Kaingu said his ministry has come up with different programs that are helping to fight poverty and address the public's welfare in all the 72 districts of the country. Programs like the social cash transfer, support to older people, and people with disabilities, and the street children projects are some of the programs that the government is implementing in addressing the problem.\n",

A reversal was feared of recent advancement against traditional discrimination of woman and minority groups because of the lack of access to assistance, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon said. They cautioned impunity was prevalent, a political will to solve human rights problems including poverty absent and a purely military solution to the conflict impossible.

According to a UNIDO press release, Yumkella pointed out that gender equality and the empowerment of women in the countries of the \"bottom billion,\" where people live on less than a dollar a day, are not only crucial components in the fight against poverty, hunger and disease, but also key for effective and sustainable industrialized development. Yumkella said that March 8 will be International Women's day. Women have made great economic, political and social achievements, but there is still a lot of work to be done, because no enduring solution to society's most threatening social, economic and political problems can be found without the full and equal participation of women. Therefore, he called for combined efforts to overcome the inequities that create serious impediments to women's entrepreneurial activities.

Balancing economic and social development and strengthening all aspects of social development with the focus on improving people's lives Efforts were intensified to increase employment and improve the social safety net. We improved our policy to stimulate and expand employment by encouraging business startups, and enforced the minimum wage system. The coverage of all social security schemes continued to expand, with 17.53 million more urban workers subscribing to basic old-age insurance, 20.28 million more subscribing to basic medical insurance, and the unemployment, workers' compensation and maternity insurance steadily expanding to cover more workers. Pensions of enterprise retirees rose by 110 yuan per month per person. We launched trials to reform the basic old-age insurance system for employees of government- affiliated institutions. We actively explored ways to establish a new system of old-age insurance for rural residents and made steady progress in making social security available to rural migrant workers in urban areas and farmers whose land has been expropriated. We comprehensively improved the system of cost of living allowances for both urban and rural residents, and provided allowances to 66.19 million residents. We raised living allowances for low-income groups and university students in a timely fashion. Preferential treatment enjoyed by key entitled groups was increased substantially. We intensified efforts to develop low-income housing and renovate shantytowns, thus alleviating some of the housing difficulties of the low-income population. An additional of more than 48 million rural people gained access to safe drinking water. Further progress was made in promoting fair education for all. Free compulsory education became available to all students, urban or rural, throughout the country, and all rural students receiving compulsory education obtained free textbooks. The standards for repairing and renovating school buildings in the central and western regions were raised, and the government allocated 3.25 billion yuan to provide heating to rural primary and secondary schools in the north. Development of vocational education was accelerated. The national financial aid system for students was further improved. The central government spent 22.3 billion yuan and local governments increased funding as well to assist more than 20 million students. Grants of 1,500 yuan per student per annum were given to secondary vocational school students from rural areas or needy urban families, benefiting 90% of the current student population in these vocational schools. Steady progress was made in reform and development of the pharmaceutical and health care system. A total of 814 million people, accounting for 91.5% of the rural population, now benefit from the new type of rural cooperative medical care system. The number of selected cities participating in trials of the basic medical insurance system for urban residents increased from 88 to 317, and the number of participating individuals increased by 73.59 million to 117 million. Significant progress was made in developing a system of community-based health services in urban areas. We continued to expand the coverage of the reward and assistance system for rural families complying with family planning regulations, and implemented the \"lower birthrate equals faster prosperity\" program in more places in the countryside. We accelerated the development of culture and sports. Public cultural infrastructure facilities were improved, the cultural industries developed rapidly, and reform of the cultural management system was constantly deepened. We mobilized all resources and hosted a distinctive and high-level Beijing Olympics and Paralympics, thus fulfilling the century-old dream of the Chinese nation, and Chinese athletes competed hard and brave and scored excellent achievements in the Games. This greatly aroused the patriotism of all our people and strengthened the cohesiveness of our nation.\n",

We will adopt even more vigorous and effective policies and measures to stabilize market confidence and expectations, keep real estate investment stable, and promote steady and orderly development of the real estate industry. We will speed up implementation and improvement of policies and measures to promote development of low-income housing projects. We will strive to solve the housing problems of 7.5 million low- income urban families and 2.4 million families living in shantytowns in forests, on reclaimed land and around coalmines within three years. This year, the central government will allocate 49.3 billion yuan for the construction of low-income housing to increase funding for developing low-rent housing and improving housing conditions in shantytowns, and increase housing subsidies for the central and western regions by an appropriate amount. We will expand the pilot program for renovating dilapidated houses in rural areas and build permanent housing for nomads in ethnic minority areas. A pilot program will be launched in selected places where conditions permit to use the idle portion of the housing accumulation fund to support development of affordable housing. We will vigorously develop public rental housing. We will effectively implement credit, tax and other policies to support people in purchasing homes and making home improvements. Individuals who meet relevant criteria and apply for bank loans to support the purchase of a second home for personal use will enjoy similar preferential lending policies that apply to the purchase of first homes. We will implement the policy to reduce or exempt the business tax on housing transfers to varying degrees based on the age of the housing. We will expand consumption and supply of ordinary commercial housing, and increase credit support for building small and medium-sized condominiums at low and medium price levels. We will speed up development of the market for second-hand homes and the home rental market. We will encourage and guide local governments to stabilize and develop their real estate market in light of local conditions, and strengthen supervision of the housing market by type. We will continue to rectify order in the real estate market, and standardize transactions. We will help rural migrant workers in cities solve their housing problems. We will deepen reform of the urban housing system to meet people's multilevel housing demand, and strive to ensure adequate housing for everyone. Fourth, we will accelerate recovery and reconstruction of areas hit by the Wenchuan earthquake. We will promptly and fully implement the master plan for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction. The central government will allocate 130 billion yuan for this purpose this year. We will quickly rebuild homes for quake-affected urban and rural residents by combining repair and reinforcement of existing housing with construction of new housing. We will basically complete reconstruction of rural houses collapsed or badly damaged during the earthquake, and ensure quake-stricken residents can move into new houses by the end of this year. We will accelerate rebuilding of schools in the quake zone and ensure that more than 95% of the students whose school buildings were destroyed in the earthquake will have permanent school buildings. We will continue work to repair and rebuild infrastructure such as transportation, communications, energy and water conservancy facilities. We will effectively prevent and control geological disasters, restore the ecosystem, improve the environment, and resume cultivation of damaged arable land. We will speed up industrial rebuilding and development in the quake zone on the basis of the plan to adjust and reinvigorate key industries. We will continue to provide one-to- one assistance and special aid to the quake zone and manage and use funds, goods and materials for post-earthquake reconstruction well. We will intensify and accelerate post-earthquake reconstruction and strive to basically reach the targets in two years that had originally been set for three, so that residents of the quake zone can begin to live a happier life as soon as possible. 3. Consolidating and strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and promoting steady development of agriculture and continuous increase in rural incomes We will focus on the following five areas. First, we will steadily develop grain production. We will effectively keep the area planted in grain crops stable, focus on increasing the yield per unit area and optimizing the variety mix, and increase the country's grain production capacity by 50 million tons.\n",

The central government and governments at the provincial level allocated 28.64 billion yuan to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in innovating technology, upgrading products and expanding into international markets. Trials were carried out in investment of venture capital. We improved the credit guarantee system for small and medium-sized enterprises, and granted rewards and subsidies to agencies providing guarantees for them. More enterprises became eligible for guaranteed small loans, the central government raised subsidies for interest on guaranteed small loans, and a mechanism for rewarding lending institutions and a mechanism for risk sharing and compensation in the event of losses from nonperforming loans were set up. Preferential taxation policies were adopted to promote development of small and medium-sized enterprises. We supported efforts to stabilize exports. We increased export rebate rates for textiles, garments and other labor-intensive products, as well as high value added products with high technology content four times. Export tariffs on some steel and chemical products and grain were rescinded, and export tariffs on some chemical fertilizers were lowered and collection methods adjusted. 4. A powerful effort to fight natural disasters and provide disaster relief The government allocated relief funds totaling 47.91 billion yuan in a strong response to low temperatures and snow and ice storms that occurred in some areas of the south at the beginning of the year. The level of assistance to disaster victims rose to help them with the temporary difficulties they had in their lives and ensure their basic living conditions. We provided strong support to efforts to resume agricultural production, rebuild collapsed housing and repair infrastructure facilities such as power grids, transportation and education. After the devastating earthquake hit Wenchuan in Sichuan Province on May 12, we quickly launched a contingency fiscal plan for the earthquake and promptly took effective measures to arrange adequate relief funds. The central government allocated 38.437 billion yuan in rescue and relief funds and local governments, 24.328 billion yuan. A fund of 74 billion yuan was allocated to the central government fund for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction, of which 69.87 billion yuan was actually spent, including 38 billion yuan for rebuilding urban and rural housing, 9.749 billion yuan for repairing infrastructure, 4.8 billion yuan for rebuilding industry and 2.436 billion yuan for preventing and reducing disasters. We cut general public spending in state organs by 5%, and all of the savings were used to provide disaster relief. Nineteen provinces and municipalities directly under the central government now set aside at least 1% of their annual regular revenue each year to aid designated quake-hit areas. Fiscal and taxation policies were implemented to support disaster relief and post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction. Donations were closely monitored and tightly managed to ensure their effective use. 5. Steady progress in fiscal and taxation reforms\n",

Rural per capita net income reached 4,761 yuan and urban per capita disposable income came to 15,781 yuan, rising by 8% and 8.4% in real terms respectively. Policies to promote employment and to stimulate job creation by encouraging entrepreneurship were improved; 11.13 million new jobs were created for urban residents, and the registered urban unemployment rate stood at 4.2% at the end of the year. The social safety net continued to expand. There were 17.53 million people newly covered by urban basic old-age insurance, 93.87 million by urban basic medical insurance, 7.55 million by unemployment insurance, 16.37 million by workers’ compensation and 14.06 million by maternity insurance. The level of basic old-age pensions for enterprise retirees was raised by 110 yuan per person per month. Trials of providing basic medical insurance for non-working urban residents were extended to 229 more cities. The new type of rural cooperative medical care system was set up in all targeted counties or county-level cities and districts. Further progress was made in developing the social security system for farmers whose land was expropriated. A total of 630,000 dwelling units of low-rent housing were built in urban areas, and the housing problem for a total of 1.9 million low-income urban families was resolved by providing them with low-income housing or granting them rent subsidies. Energetic progress was made in developing community-based services, children's welfare facilities, facilities for assisting and protecting homeless juveniles, and facilities providing comprehensive services for people with disabilities. Poverty alleviation through development was intensified, and the poverty line was raised again. Work-relief funds were used for developing 72,000 hectares of basic farmland. The potable-water problem was solved for 1.9 million people and 1.1 million heads of livestock in poverty-stricken areas. In the western region, 320,000 people were relocated from inhospitable places as a poverty relief effort. Social programs were strengthened. Free compulsory education was made universal in all urban and rural areas of the country. Vocational education developed at a faster pace. The system of financial aid for students from poor families was gradually improved. Conditions were improved in rural primary and junior secondary schools. A total of 6.89 million square meters of living facilities were built for 3,519 rural junior secondary schools. Support was provided for strengthening the infrastructure of 722 secondary vocational schools and county- level vocational education centers. There were 182 special education schools newly built, renovated or expanded. The third phase of the 211 Higher Education Project was begun. The secondary gross enrollment ratio was eight percentage points higher than the previous year. Regular undergraduate enrollment increased by 420,000, and graduate enrollment by 27,000. Development of community-level medical care services and family planning facilities was accelerated. Support was provided for building more than 20,000 clinics in towns and townships, 430 county hospitals, 209 Chinese medicine hospitals, and 369 maternity and child health centers. Special funds were used for developing 159 key Chinese medicine hospitals at or above the prefecture level, 1,231 county-level family planning service facilities and central family planning service stations for towns and townships, and more than 8,800 village clinics in remote areas plagued by serious infectious or endemic diseases. The natural population growth rate stood at 5.08‰. Support was significantly strengthened for programs such as extending radio and TV coverage to all villages, building multipurpose cultural centers in towns and townships, protecting cultural and natural heritage sites, and developing tourism. The press and publishing, literature and art, philosophy and the social sciences all prospered. The development of urban and rural public sports facilities was intensified.  (More)\n",

      "(8). 8. Great success was achieved in fighting devastating natural disasters. When parts of south China were hit with severe snow and ice storms at the beginning of the year, all localities and sectors, in accordance with the unified arrangements made by the central authorities, immediately set emergency response mechanisms in motion, did everything in their power to ensure transport, power supply and people's livelihood, and restored agricultural and industrial production as well as disaster-destroyed infrastructure in a short period of time. In the wake of the massive earthquake that hit Wenchuan, Sichuan Province on May 12, the whole nation was quickly mobilized. Forces of all kinds, including members of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed Police Forces, the militia, reserve forces, and public security personnel, as well as health workers, journalists, scientists and volunteers, responded promptly. Compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and overseas Chinese made generous donations. The international community offered us a helping hand. Together, we achieved a great victory in the fight against the earthquake and wrote a moving, heroic paean memorializing our brave efforts. We pulled 84,000 survivors from the rubble, provided medical treatment to 2.96 million people who were injured or fell ill, and delivered aid to a total of 10.584 million people affected by the earthquake. In order to rebuild the disaster areas more effectively, the Regulations on Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction were formulated. With the approval of the NPC Standing Committee, a recovery and reconstruction fund was set up. The overall plan for recovery and reconstruction and ten specific plans were drawn up in a short period of time. Provinces (or province-level municipalities) were paired up with severely hit counties (or county-level cities), with each province providing assistance to its twin county. All recovery and reconstruction plans are being implemented quickly, and over 8,400 projects have been started already. Lives and production are returning to normal in the disaster-hit regions. Despite drastic changes in the global economic and financial situation and a marked increase in unexpected difficulties at home, notable achievements were made in economic and social development in 2008, and none of them came easily. They would not have been possible without the strong leadership and scientific decision-making of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, close collaboration and hard work of all localities and sectors, or the resolve, unity and painstaking efforts of the people of all ethnic groups. While fully recognizing these achievements, we are keenly aware that the global and domestic economic situations are grim and complex, and that the task of maintaining steady and fairly rapid economic growth has become more formidable. The spread of the international financial crisis has exerted an enormous impact on the global economy, and the breadth, depth and intensity of the impact have exceeded everyone's expectations: the economies of major developed countries might all fall into recession, emerging market economies and developing countries are experiencing slowdowns in growth, and the world economy will experience a long period of stagnation and adjustment. In addition, there has been mounting global deflationary pressure and resurging trade protectionism, which will add more uncertainties and instabilities. The impact of the global financial crisis and many outstanding problems at home have suddenly made it more difficult to keep our economy going strong. We have not yet improved the extensive pattern of development or solved institutional and structural problems, including poor independent innovation capacity, unsuitable industrial structure, imbalance between domestic and external demand, the high toll on natural resources and the environment, the disproportion between investment and consumption, and imbalances between economic and social development, between rural and urban areas, and between different regions. In particular, the slowdown in economic growth has become a significant economic problem since the fourth quarter of last year. First, industrial production declined significantly. The growth of value-added of large industrial enterprises dropped by 9.7, 11.9 and 11.7 percentage points year on year in October, November and December respectively. Demand for energy, raw materials and transport shrank; prices of products such as steel and electrolytic aluminum fell; the problem of excess production capacity became apparent. Second, some consumption hotspots cooled down. The total floor area of commodity housing sold throughout the year decreased by 19.7%. The growth of automobile sales was 15.1 percentage points less than the previous year. Demand for other commodities, consumption of which had grown fast in recent years, also shrank by varying degrees. Third, foreign trade dropped sharply, with exports down by 2.2% and 2.8% year on year in November and December respectively. Fourth, some enterprises faced the difficult situation of fewer orders, sluggish sales and reduced profits. These problems spread from coastal regions to the hinterland, from small- and medium-sized enterprises to large ones, and from export-oriented industries to other industries. Many more enterprises than before suffered losses. Meanwhile, there are also acute problems concerning employment, agriculture, rural areas and farmers, energy conservation and pollution reduction and the financial sector. There has been mounting pressure on employment and reemployment. Enterprises' demand for workers decreased significantly. The number of people joining the urban workforce in October, November and December dropped each month, standing at 840,000, 550,000 and 380,000 respectively. The employment situation for college graduates, urban residents having difficulty finding jobs and rural migrant workers has become worse. There are many factors restraining the growth of agricultural production and farmers' incomes. Agricultural infrastructure remains weak. After five years of bumper harvests in a row, it will be very difficult to keep grain production growing steadily. There is great downward pressure on prices of farm products. The return home of many rural migrant workers and their difficulty in finding steady jobs makes it harder to keep rural residents' incomes growing. It is now more difficult to promote energy conservation and pollution reduction. Energy-conserving technologies and services are developing slowly due to the objective fact that they are still in the early stage of development. Moreover, because enterprises are facing more difficulties and some are not operating at full capacity, they spend less on technological upgrading and pollution reduction, which leads to a drop in their energy efficiency and ineffective operation of their pollution control equipment. Therefore, there will be great pressure to achieve energy conservation and pollution reduction targets in the last two years of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period. Potential risks in financial markets cannot be ignored, and confidence in the capital market urgently needs to be strengthened. There is chaos in the market order of some sectors, and workplace accidents and major food safety incidents repeatedly occur, inflicting heavy losses on people's lives and property. We will take vigorous steps to solve the above problems and minimize their adverse impact.  (More)\n",

      "Full Text: Work report of NPC Standing Committee (4). Second, we promoted transformation of the pattern of economic development. Accelerating change in the pattern of economic development and promoting improvement and upgrading of the industrial structure are pressing and major strategic tasks that have an overall bearing on the national economy. The Standing Committee heard and deliberated the State Council's report on the intermediate assessment of the implementation of the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan at its December meeting. Those present at the meeting fully acknowledged the achievements made, analyzed problems from an objective perspective, and made pertinent suggestions. They noted that the assessment showed satisfactory progress was being made toward most of the targets set forth in the outline and that the outline was being implemented satisfactorily on the whole. However, three of the four indices reflecting the condition of the economic structure - added value of the service sector, employment in the service sector, and R&D expenditures - failed to achieve the expected progress, and two major binding targets - energy consumption per unit of GDP and total emissions of major pollutants - fell far short of the set goals. To a great extent this showed that the pattern of China's economic development had not been transformed fundamentally: industry still holds the dominant position in the industrial structure, exports and investment still play the leading role in the demand structure, and serious problems such as mounting pressure on resources and the environment, increasing difficulty in expanding employment, and insufficient consumption still exist. We proposed that the State Council and relevant departments attach great importance to these problems, accelerate the implementation of the \"three transformations\" in the pattern of economic development [transformation from relying mainly on investment and exports to relying on a well coordinated combination of consumption, investment and exports, transformation from secondary industry serving as the major driving force to primary, secondary and tertiary industries jointly driving economic growth, and transformation from relying heavily on increased consumption of material resources to relying mainly on advances in science and technology, improvement in the quality of the workforce and innovation in management - Tr.] in accordance with the guiding principles of the Seventeenth Congress, and work harder to fulfill the objectives and tasks set forth in the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. The Standing Committee also prodded governments at all levels and other concerned parties to apply the Scientific Outlook on Development and transform the pattern of economic development by enacting the Law to Promote a Circular Economy, revising the Patent Law, hearing and deliberating the State Council's report on preventing and controlling water pollution, and investigating compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Law. Third, we promoted reform and development in rural areas. Doing the work related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers well has an overall bearing on the progress of the cause of the Party and the state. The last Standing Committee made significant achievements in tracking and overseeing these problems over the course of five consecutive years. Last year the Standing Committee heard and deliberated the State Council's report on spurring steady increase in rural incomes and related reports and made important suggestions on how to do a good job in work related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers. It investigated compliance with the Law on Specialized Farmer Cooperatives and acquired an in- depth understanding of the development of all types of specialized farmer cooperatives and the major problems facing them. We called for the implementation of all the policy support stipulated by the law to enable them to play a bigger role in strengthening the organization of farmers and guiding them in competing in domestic and international markets. The oversight by the NPC effectively promoted the building of a new socialist countryside. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the State Council, local governments at all levels and farmers, the growth rate of rural per capita net income reached 8% in 2008 following an annual increase of over 300 yuan or more than 6% over the previous four years running. Both total output and the yield per unit area reached an all-time high in the same year. By the end of 2008, the number of specialized farmer cooperatives nationwide exceeded 110,000, covering over 1.4 million households. The average annual income of rural households that have joined the cooperatives was more than 20% higher than that of those that have not. While fully confirming these achievements, members of the Standing Committee also pointed out that we needed to attach great importance to problems such as the still low overall income level of farmers, the widening income gap between urban and rural residents, the declining comparative returns from agriculture, backward agricultural infrastructure, and new difficulties facing rural workers looking for nonagricultural employment. They also pointed out the need to effectively promote rural reform, significantly increase our funding for agriculture, rural areas and farmers, strictly protect arable land, gradually make the prices of grain and other agricultural products more reasonable, constantly improve financial and technical services to aid agriculture and benefit farmers, support and guide the development of the non-public sector of the economy and rural workers seeking employment in a variety of nonagricultural sectors, maintain steady agricultural development and sustain increase in rural incomes.

      "summit. Over 12,000 people from across Britain and Europe marched through central London on Saturday ahead of the G20 summit, demanding decent jobs and public services for all, an end to global poverty and inequality, as well as a green economy. The march organized under the banner of \"Put People First\" started at 11:00 in the morning, drawing members from over 150 unions, development, faith and environment groups in a unified call for a coordinated fiscal stimulus to create and preserve jobs, international action to ensure that an out-of-control finance sector never threatens the stability of the global economy again and a commitment from world leaders that they will move to a low carbon economy. In an unprecedented alliance of supporters of Put People First which range from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) to the Salvation Army, Friends of the Earth to Oxfam and Shelter to War on Want, the demonstrators held out slogans such as \"Workers for the world united,\" \"Knowledge is power,\" \"Drop the debt,\" \"Clean up global finance,\" \"Smash Capitalism\" and \"Climate emergency,\" expressing their anger at the policies that have seen poverty exist alongside huge top banker bonuses. \"We're angry because this is not a natural disaster, but a crisis due to irresponsible and reckless behavior. We're angry about the inequality that ordinary people are paying the price,\" said Brendan Barber, General Secretary of Trade Union Congress ( TUC) which represents 6.5 million people, later at a rally held in Hyde Park.

      "(15). IV. Government and Market: Encouragement and Promotion for Development The evolution of history has proved that building and perfecting the market and its system can optimize the distribution of essential factors of production and promote the flow of manpower, merchandise, capital and services, in order to achieve a better division of specialized labor, update concepts and boost economic development. While stressing the market's fundamental role in development, we should also recognize that the government should play the role of a night watcher to maintain order, property rights and social stability, as well as institute strategies for economic development, provide public services, encourage competition, prevent monopoly, minimize negative external economic effects, promote fair distribution, alleviate and decrease poverty, and so on. 1. Market and Resource Distribution Now, the market system has been established primarily in Tibet, and the market's function in regulating local economic life is obvious. Government control on prices of consumer goods, including the prices of farm produce and many other products, has been lifted. The free flow of manpower, materials and capital in Tibet has been realized. Today, Tibet's markets are full of commercial goods from all over China and the rest of the world. During the time of the planned economy daily foodstuffs like vegetables were in short supply, and many Tibetan residents would bring vegetables from inland areas on their flights back to Tibet. After the market mechanism was introduced the unreasonable price gap between consumer goods and agricultural goods created by the planned economy vanished. The price rise of most agricultural and livestock products far exceeds that of consumer goods, and farmers and herdsmen have profited greatly from the market. For instance, in the time of the planned economy a kilo of yak meat cost less than one yuan but now people have to pay more than 20 yuan for the same amount of meat. A robust yak could even swap for a walking tractor.\n",

Following the principle of \"being prompt and precise, open and transparent,\" the central and local governments are expected to work in earnest on the emergency information release work concerning natural disasters and other emergencies, offering through authorized releases, press releases, interviews and press conferences to the public prompt information on the disasters and their developments, progress of emergency response work, disaster prevention, and knowledge on disaster prevention and other information, thus ensuring the public's rights to know and supervise. -- Relief materials reserve system. China has built a relief materials reserve network based on special storehouses, which has seen year-on-year improvements. The country has now ten such storehouses for daily necessities at the central level, and storage centers for relief supply, flood and forest fire control supplies are continuously being built and improved. Coupled with the reserve relief supply centers established in some provinces, cities and counties, a preliminary disaster control and relief materials reserve system has taken shape. To guarantee the timely purchase of relief supplies, a list of commissioned relief supply manufacturers is established, and emergency purchase agreements signed with them for the supply of relief materials in case of emergency. -- Disaster early warning, consultation and information sharing mechanism. A disaster early warning, consultation and information sharing mechanism has been set up, involving such relevant departments as civil affairs, land and resources, water resources, agriculture, forestry, statistics, seismology, maritime affairs and meteorology. To offer timely and effective support for the decision-making of the central government and local departments in case of emergency, China has initiated the construction of a disaster information database and launched a public platform of national geographical information and a disaster information publishing and sharing system, as well as a platform for national disaster reduction and risk management information. -- Major disaster rescue and relief joint coordination mechanism. In the wake of a major disaster, relevant departments will play their functions and timely dispatch to disaster-hit areas working groups composed of personnel from these departments to gather first-hand information and guide disaster control and relief work on the spot. The groups are also required by the State Council to coordinate with the relevant departments to map out rescue plans, help with disaster relief work and prevent possible secondary disasters. -- Disaster emergency response public mobilization mechanism. A preliminary public mobilization system is now in place, focusing on efforts for rescue, search, first aid, relief, donation and other work. The government also gives full scope to non- government organizations, such as mass organizations, the Red Cross, self-governmental organizations at the grassroots level and individual volunteers in the fields of disaster prevention, emergency rescue, relief and donation work, medical, hygiene and quarantine work, post-disaster reconstruction, psychological support and other aspects.

Establishing an Emergency Rescue and Disaster Relief Response System, and Improving Emergency Handling Capabilities A disaster relief emergency response system has taken initial shape, with emergency rescue team system, emergency response mechanism and emergency fund appropriation mechanism as its main items. Emergency handling capabilities such as emergency rescue, transportation support, help with daily life, sanitation and epidemic prevention have been greatly enhanced. -- Emergency rescue team system. An emergency rescue team system has taken initial shape, with the public security forces, armed police and armed forces as the main and task force, with special teams such as flood fighting and emergency rescue, earthquake relief, forest fire, maritime search and rescue, mine rescue, and medical care teams as the basic force, with full-time and part- time teams attached to enterprises and public institutions and emergency volunteers as the backup force. The state's land, air search and rescue base construction has been accelerated, and emergency rescue equipment has been further improved. -- Emergency rescue response mechanism. The central government- stipulated responses to unexpected natural disasters are divided into four levels, which are determined by the degree of damage done. The concrete response measures at different levels have been expressly defined, and disaster relief work has been incorporated into a standard management process. The establishment of a disaster rescue emergency response mechanism basically guarantees that people affected by a disaster can receive aid within 24 hours. They are supplied with \"food, clothing, clean water, temporary housing, medical treatment and schooling.\" -- Disaster relief emergency fund appropriation mechanism. A disaster relief fund appropriation mechanism of the central government has been established, including funds for daily life of those affected by natural disasters, funds for severe flood control and drought combat, funds for roads damaged by flood, funds for inland waterway channel rush-repair, funds for medical rescue, funds for culture, education and administration endeavors, and funds for disaster relief in agriculture and forestry. The disaster relief management system characterized by management of disaster relief by levels and funds shared by different levels is being actively promoted. Disaster relief input by local governments must be guaranteed so as to ensure the basic livelihood of people affected by disasters.\n",

      "(17). V. Public Participation in Disaster Reduction The Chinese government regards it important to give full play to the role of the public in disaster prevention and reduction, and supports and promotes wide public participation in such work by making people more aware and capable of disaster prevention and reduction. The Chinese government timely releases information on disaster situations and demands from disaster-hit areas. It has strengthened its guidance, standardized management and provided guarantee services. Meanwhile, it is making continuous efforts to improve its social mobilization mechanism, and integrate resources from both government and society to form a disaster relief pattern in which they will complement each other with their respective strengths. People of all walks of life are actively involved in disaster relief efforts whenever there is a big natural disaster. Compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin all provide aid and donations to disaster-hit areas in China. During the devastating Wenchuan earthquake of 2008, China received nearly 76 billion yuan-worth of donations and relief materials from both in and outside China. Personalized services such as psychological help from the public have also been effective in building the confidence of people in disaster- stricken areas. Charities play a key role in disaster relief, and the government has adopted measures to support their development. In terms of the preferential taxation system that encourages public donations, the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China, which became effective in January 2008, stipulates that the portion of expenses for charitable donations by enterprises is unified to within 12 percent of the total annual profit and it is to be deducted from the taxable income, instead of the 3 percent as was the practice before. After the Wenchuan earthquake, the government stipulated that donations from enterprises and individuals made through public welfare organizations, people's governments and their departments at or above the county level to disaster-hit areas can be totally deducted from the enterprises' and individuals' taxable income for the year. In December 2008, the government department concerned issued a notice detailing the scope of public welfare undertakings managing public welfare donations, the qualification of tax-free donations from public welfare organizations, and the authorization and procedures for certifying such qualifications. The state encourages the normal development of foundations. By the end of 2008, there were 1,531 foundations of various kinds in China, 162 more than in the previous year. In recent years, the government has been helping charity organizations to enhance their reputation, and promoting annual checkups and evaluations of such foundations. (more)\n",

      "(19). VI. International Cooperation in Disaster Prevention and Reduction Adopting an open and cooperative attitude, China takes an active part in international efforts in the area of disaster reduction, in the construction and improvement of an international cooperative disaster-reduction mechanism, in building up a worldwide capacity in this regard, and in providing mutual aid with other countries in major natural disasters. China has actively taken part in disaster-reduction cooperation within the framework of the United Nations, and has built up close partnership relations with many UN organizations, including the UN Development Program, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, UN World Food Program, UN Food and Agricultural Organization and the UN Committee for the Peaceful Use of Outer Space. In March 2006, China donated US$1 million to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund. In November of the same year, the Chinese government and UN organizations in China jointly held a symposium on emergency aid in retrospective of the Indian Ocean tsunami, reviewing the use of China’s multilateral emergency aid. China has worked with the International Strategy Committee for Disaster Reduction in establishing the International Centre for Drought Risk Reduction, and has involved in the work of the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) and has been proactive in setting up its Beijing Office. Experts sent from China have joined the UN disaster evaluation team, repeatedly undertaking UN tasks. Actively involved with the advisory country connected with UN international search and rescue activities, China has been vigorously promoting global cooperation in the aspect of disaster emergency relief, and hosted the UN’s Asian- Pacific area earthquake emergency response practice in 2006. China has played an active role in building up a dialogue and exchange platform for disaster reduction between Asian countries. In September 2005, the Chinese government hosted the first Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Beijing, which adopted the Beijing Action Plan for Reducing Disaster Risks in Asia and laid the basis for further cooperation between Asian countries in this regard. An active participant in the second and third Asian ministerial conferences, China, together with its Asian neighbors, was constructive in formulating the Delhi Declaration on Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia 2007, and the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Disaster Risk Reduction 2008. In December 2008, China held a symposium on strengthening Asian countries’ capability for coping with calamitous disasters. China sets great store by discussing the signing of bilateral and multilateral agreements on disaster prevention and reduction with member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) and countries in south Asia, and by human resources development and cooperation in this regard. In May 2005, China held a human resources training class on disaster prevention and reduction for countries suffering from the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In May 2006, China hosted a China- ASEAN seminar on disaster prevention and reduction in Beijing. In 2007, China hosted a symposium on emergency response and disaster relief of ASEAN and Asian countries, a seminar on disaster risk management and a seminar on post-disaster reconstruction. China is actively involved in ASEAN’s activities for disaster management, attending various kinds of symposiums sponsored by ASEAN, observing emergency response exercises, and discussing proactively the formation of a China-ASEAN cooperative agreement and action plan.

      "(20). China has promoted inter-governmental cooperation in disaster relief among the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member states. In April 2002, leaders of emergency relief departments of the SCO member states held their first meeting in Russia's St. Petersburg. In April 2003, an expert conference was held in Beijing to discuss the Inter-Governmental Mutual Aid Agreement among SCO Member States. In October 2005, this Agreement was signed in Moscow. In November 2006, the second such meeting was held in Beijing, and adopted the 2007-2008 Action Plan for Mutual Aid in Disaster Relief among SCO Member States, which laid the framework for carrying out activities in disaster relief communications, information exchange, disaster relief in border areas, personnel training and technological exchanges. In September 2007, leaders of emergency relief departments of SCO member states held their third meeting in Bishkek, discussing the implementation of the agreement on disaster relief cooperation and furthering such cooperation. The SCO member states also decided to set up the SCO Natural and Man-made Disaster Relief Center. In late September 2008, China hosted the first meeting of the heads of border areas among SCO member states in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The meeting reached a consensus on issues concerning disaster relief cooperation in the border areas of SCO member states, expediting the establishment of a joint disaster-relief action mechanism in border areas, and information exchanges and personnel training. In coping with major natural disasters, China has engaged in mutual support and aid with the international community. After the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, China provided the largest emergency aid in its history, totaling 687.63 million yuan, to the affected countries and related UN agencies. It also promptly dispatched an international rescue team and a medical team to Indonesia. On August 29, 2005, hurricane “Katrina” hit the southern part of the United States. The Chinese government provided a relief fund of US$5 million to the United States, together with a batch of emergency aid materials. After an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale rocked Pakistan on October 8, 2005, the Chinese government sent emergency humanitarian aid worth US$26.73 million to that country. From October 9 to November 29, Chinese airplanes carried disaster relief materials on 26 flights to Pakistan, and Chinese international emergency rescue teams and medical teams were dispatched to the quake-hit areas. In 2008, after the strong tropical storm \"Nargis\" hit Myanmar, the Chinese government sent emergency aid materials worth US$1 million to Myanmar, which was followed by relief funds of 30 million yuan and US$10 million, as well as a medical team. After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, China received much support from the international community. Over 170 countries and regions, as well as more than 20 international organizations, provided funds totaling over 4.4 billion yuan and large batches of relief materials to China. Professional rescue and medical teams came from Russia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore to help with the emergency relief efforts in the affected areas. Nine medical teams with a total of 223 medical and technical workers were sent by the governments of the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, Italy, France, Cuba, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Red Cross of Germany to participate in medical aid in the disaster- stricken areas of Sichuan and Gansu provinces. In Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, one of the worst-hit areas, 16 volunteers from countries including the United States, United Kingdom and Mexico started their rescue work immediately after their arrival. A UK rescue group of ten volunteers also came to search for victims and the missing in the same areas. Many satellites, such as ALOS of Japan, COSMO-SkyMed of Italy and LandSat of the United States, offered remote- sensing images of the quake-hit areas. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for all this help.(more)\n",

Simultaneously, the world's poorest are also bearing the brunt of climate change, linked to the world's unsustainable use of natural resources, Clark said in her first address to the Executive Board since she assumed office. \"These global problems reflect our interdependence, and they require global solutions,\" she said, calling for a multilateral system to boost the standard of living for the most vulnerable people and ensure their voices are taken into account by decision- makers.\n",

In a statement issued in Nairobi, acting UNICEF Representative to Somalia Hannan Sulieman said the development would compound children's extreme and already protracted suffering by hampering their access to crucial life-saving services. Suleiman said the take-over of UNICEF's compound by militiamen following the fall of Jowhar town in Central Somalia under the control of Al Shabaab members on May 17 and the subsequent looting and destruction of life-saving humanitarian supplies and equipments have enormously affected UNICEF's ability to deliver services to the most vulnerable children and women. \"While local authorities and UNICEF maintain cooperative relationships in many areas of Somalia, we are witnessing and experiencing an unprecedented level of aggression against humanitarian work in Jowhar, a situation that should cause a great deal of concern not only to the aid community but primarily to Somali communities.\" said Sulieman.\n",

Resources must be committed to help the poorest and most vulnerable adapt to climate change as well as to \"seal the deal\" on an ambitious new pact in December in Copenhagen to replace the Kyoto Protocol, whose first commitment period ends in 2012, the letter says.

Walter Kaelin, the representative of the UN Secretary General on the human rights of IDPs,  told reporters here that the most vulnerable people to the hunger situation are the elderly, persons with disabilities, orphans and child- headed homes. \"The phase out of food distribution and the current drought exacerbate the risk for extremely vulnerable individuals to become hunger victims,\" he said after visiting the remaining IDP camps, transit sites and return areas in Gulu and Pader districts. The UN World Food Program and other humanitarian agencies started scaling down their food distribution to the region following the return of peace after over 20 years of conflict and the resettlement of some IDPs back to their home areas. The region, like other parts of the East African country, is facing a food crisis due to the prolonged dry spells and unpredictable rain seasons which have destroyed crops in the fields.\n",

      "Developing Asian gov'ts urged to enhance cash transfers to poor. Developing Asian governments should continue to provide cash incentives to vulnerable groups in exchange of their participation in programs that would benefit the long-term economic development, such as prenatal care, nutrition programs, or school attendance, a senior official of a leading development bank said Thursday. Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice-President Ursula Schaefer- Preuss told a forum here that despite Asia's remarkable success in sustaining growth, several countries in the region still face major challenges of extreme poverty. Preuss said enhancing the use of conditional cash transfers ( CCT) can form part of the solution. \"CCTs are particularly attractive policy options during economic downturns, because they provide countercyclical funds into the hands of the most vulnerable, who are likely to spend the money on essential items such as food and housing,\" she said. \" They, therefore, have an immediate welfare and poverty reducing effect -- through provision of cash -- and a longer term developmental effect through their potential to improve human health and education.\" Some 900 million people in Asia still live below the poverty line of 1.25 U.S. dollars a day. With the global economic slowdown now spreading to the region, the ADB estimates that at least 60 million people who would otherwise have been lifted out will remain mired in extreme poverty.\n",

The indicators show that maternal mortality rates remain unacceptably high in many countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Nepal, while more than a quarter of urban households in 13 countries still lack access to improved sanitation. The region's fast growth in recent years has also put severe strains on the environment, with developing Asian countries becoming heavy contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, it said. But the development bank said Asia has made significant progress in reducing extreme poverty. The number of poor was reduced from around one in two people to around one in four over the past 15 years, it said.\n",

Bangladesh's GDP grew by 5.9 percent in the 2008-09 fiscal year ended in June, slightly lower than 6.2 percent in the previous fiscal year due mainly to global economic slowdown, the Asian Development Bank said here Tuesday. According to June 2009 issue of the Manila-based bank's Quarterly Economic Update for Bangladesh released here Tuesday, the country's GDP growth deterred because of the moderation in aggregate demand affected by a slowdown in exports and remittance inflows, and also underpinned by private consumption (about 75 percent of GDP), which rose by 6.0 percent. It said several downside risks to the economy in the near term include a delayed recovery of the global economy, likely shortfalls in revenue collections and mobilization of external financing, and the onset of natural disasters. According to the Quarterly Economic Update released through a press statement, the country's industry sector growth declined to 5.9 percent in 2008-09 from previous year's 6.8 percent as export production in the second half of the fiscal year slowed due to the global slowdown. But the South Asian country's agriculture sector managed to post 4.6 percent in growth in 2008-09, up from 3.2 in the previous 2007-08, owing to high growth in food-grain production aided by favorable weather and strong government support.\n",

      "Full Text: Development and Progress in Xinjiang (8). In recent years, export of labor services has become a new channel for Xinjiang to expand employment. For many years people living in remote areas of southern Xinjiang experienced hardships, since they mainly relied on the not very profitable farming and animal husbandry for a living. Since 2006, the Xinjiang government has launched a labor-export program first in southern Xinjiang's Jiashi County and then throughout the whole autonomous region. Through the program local rural residents could apply for positions at inland companies after signing up and going through training courses that give them the necessary qualifications. The local government is required to appoint a leader (or leaders) who supervise the migrant workers in their new company, and also take along with them Halal cooks to cater to their needs. Since 2006, Jiashi County has exported some 19,000 person-times of labor services to inland enterprises, making a total profit of almost 200 million yuan. The migrant workers enjoy an average per-capita yearly net income of 7,000 yuan, double that of local farmers and herders in 2008. The Xinjiang government attaches importance to professional training for migrant workers, spending 300 million to 400 million yuan each year on such trainings. Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policies at the end of 1978, Xinjiang's social-security system has gradually taken shape, to provide basic living guarantees for the people. The 2008 figures show that Xinjiang has 799 community services facilities in urban areas. About 9,645,700 people have taken part in the five major insurance programs, of basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, industrial injury insurance, and maternity insurance. A total of 638,000 urban residents are receiving the minimum living allowance from the government. Social welfare institutions of various types have 19,000 beds by the end of 2008, taking in 14,000 residents under their care. From July 2007, the rural minimum living allowance system was introduced, providing subsidies for farmers and herders with annual average per- capita income lower than 700 yuan. In 2008, 1,310,000 farmers and herders in extreme poverty received the subsidies. By the end of 2007, medical aid services were available in every city, district and county. In 2008 the government invested 310 million yuan in medical assistance services for a total of 2,164,000 users, including 938,000 receiving medical services and 1,226,000 persons who have participated in medical insurance programs or cooperative medical care programs. Economic development in such a large region is not balanced. Since the mid- 1980s, the local government has launched a large- scale poverty-alleviation campaign, aimed at ensuring basic subsistence for the impoverished rural population, and with a major focus on the promotion of economic and cultural development. The program also underwent changes, from providing money and food, to well-planned development-oriented poverty reduction efforts with good organization and clear goals. Over the period from 1978 to 2008, Xinjiang's impoverished population decreased from 5.32 million to 2.53 million, and their living and working conditions have been significantly improved. In recent years the state has put more efforts into poverty-alleviation in southern Xinjiang, where the situation is the most severe. From 2001 to 2007, 78% of the central and local governments' poverty- alleviation funds, work-relief subsidies and subsidized loans were invested in southern Xinjiang, where 70% of the total poverty-alleviation programs were based. Since 2004, earthquake- resistant housing programs have been carried out in quake-prone areas, a six-year plan to provide safe housing for people in these areas. The state invested 41.2 billion yuan in these programs by the end of 2008, constructing and fortifying 1,895,000 houses. In southern Xinjiang, 742,300 impoverished farming families have since moved into quakeproof housing. (more)\n",

In a statement released on Monday, the UN office said an estimated 20-30 percent of workers in garment factories, construction sites and the tourism industry have lost their jobs since late 2008, resulting in the loss of 35-40 million U.S. dollars in remittances. \"The poor, and mainly women in the case of the garment sector, are bearing the brunt of the downturn,\" it added. The most profound impacts of the downturn are being felt by the poor and near poor, particularly those who are in debt. This is especially true in rural areas, home to many of the vulnerable who moved to the cities in search of employment. The downturn presents challenges not only to individuals, but also to Cambodia's progress toward the achievement of the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals, as foreign investment in construction dwindles, garment orders decline and tourist income drops off.

      "Action Plan of China(2009-2010)(2). Over the past year, the Chinese government has adopted a series of major policies and measures, such as expanding domestic demand, restructuring economy, promoting economic growth and improving people's livelihood. The government has taken positive measures to properly cope with the international financial crisis, and has maintained sound yet rapid economic and social growth, thus effectively safeguarded people's rights to subsistence and development as well as their economic, social and cultural rights. Over this year, China has promulgated laws and regulations, including the law on intermediation and arbitration over land contract disputes in rural areas, the Food Safety Law, the regulation on the implementation of the Food Safety Law, and the regulation on fitness for all. China has also made amendments to the Labor Law, the Law on Education, the Law on Agriculture, the Law on Land Contract in Rural Areas, the Flood Control Law, and the Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, guaranteeing citizens' economic, social and cultural rights to greater extent. Meanwhile, the government has taken forceful measures to address issues that have direct bearing on people's well-being, such as employment, health care, social security, increasing farmers' income, education, production safety, prevention against communicable diseases such as A/H1N1 influenza, so that people's rights in various areas have been effectively safeguarded on the basis of steady and fast economic growth. According to statistics, over the first nine months this year, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.7 percent; income of urban and rural residents increased by 10.5 percent and 9.2 percent respectively. About 8.51 million urban residents became employed, 4.02 million laid-off workers reemployed, and 1.2 million people having difficulty in finding jobs employed in the same period. China has been actively promoting the reform of the household registration system, relaxing limits on getting such registrations in small and medium cities. Various channels have been created to get farmers employed in non-farming sectors, and migrant workers' rights and interests have been safeguarded. By the end of September, there had been 152 million migrant workers across the nation, rallying to the level before the global financial crisis. In 2009, 19.73 billion yuan from the central budget were used in poverty reduction, up by 3 billion yuan from last year, and both the growth rate and increment were the highest ever since 1998. A total of  4.13 billion yuan was poured into poverty reduction loan funds. Meanwhile, rural poverty reduction subsidies have been raised to 1,196 yuan per person, covering 40.07 million rural needy people. Poverty reduction measures will apply to all low-income groups in rural areas. Social insurance system has improved, all social insurance compensation being paid in time and in full. The population covered by basic old age insurances, basic health insurances, employment, work injury and children-bearing insurances, and population of migrant workers covered by social insurances have all expanded. By the end of September, the population covered by basic health insurance had reached 362.95 million, 44.74 million more than that of last year. The population covered by new rural cooperative health insurances reached 833 million, 16 million more than that at the end of last year, the coverage ratio staying above 90 percent. In 2009, 61.46 billion yuan of the central budgets went to assistance for urban and rural low-income groups, and 8 billion yuan was used to subsidize urban and rural low- income groups in health care, representing increases of 69.3 percent and 58.7 percent respectively. The central government has made an extra investment of 20 billion yuan in improving the basic medical and health service system, so as to realize equal access among the Chinese to public health services. China has invested more in education, and made greater efforts to develop compulsory education, education in rural areas, and vocational educati on. The central government has spent 57.9 billion yuan on the reform of rural compulsory education funds guarantee mechanism, and exempted all rural students of compulsory education period, covering primary and junior high schools, from tuition and other fees. The government has also spent 5 billion yuan on renovating school buildings in rural junior high schools in central and western China. A financing system to aid students from poor families has been established and improved, and greater efforts have been made to guarantee citizens' rights to education. (more)\n",

It is hoped that a deal would be struck on greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and on rich nations' financial and technological aid to developing countries as outlined in the Bali roadmap. Such deals will bring food to the hungry, prevent the forests from shrinking and the flora and fauna from disappearing, and make the earth a better place to live. A right choice at the Copenhagen conference will take the world one step closer to the target of sustainable development.

Governments in the region have reacted quickly, UNDP noted in a news release, with many having strengthened job security plans and social programs as a means to mitigate the negative effects of the crisis.\n",

      "for development. by Meng Bill PHNOM PENH, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian leader urged Thursday to his country's police forces to take more concerted actions on security, and social disorder as well as the preventive measures on terrorism. Delivering speech at the annual 2009 stocktaking and direction setting for 2010 at the Ministry of Interior, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen said issues relating to nuclear weapon, international terrorism, piracy, insecurity in a number of countries are taking deeper root and become more complicated in a certain country in the region. He said these challenges coupled with the impact of climate change and natural disasters might affect the efforts of the Royal Government of Cambodia for the cause of development, poverty reduction and improvement of quality of life of our people. \"Pay more attention with high sense of awareness at all time to maintain peace, political stability as well as good security environment nation-wide which facilitates development of all sectors, especially economy, trade, investment and tourism etc... aiming at accelerating poverty reduction of our people in conformity to the political platform that the government had adopted,\" he urged his police forces.\n",

China's police chief Meng Jianzhu on Monday called for greater efforts in battling against the abduction and trafficking of women and children to ensure people's dignity and basic rights. Meng, a State Councilor and Minister of Public Security, made the call at a conference participated by judicial departments and ministries including the Supreme People's Court and ministries of public security and civil affairs. Meng vowed for zero tolerance to woman and child trafficking because the crime \"grossly violates human rights.\" He asked local governments to address some economic and social problems that could be the root of rampant human trafficking, such as poverty and unemployment among the women, inadequate education of children of migrant workers in cities, and illegal use of child laborers. The public security ministry launched a special crackdown on child abduction and trafficking in April. As of Oct. 12, over 2,000 children had been rescued from more than 1,700 human trafficking cases.\n",

The International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations will launch a new project to help fishers and farmers in a Philippine province affected by conflict and natural disasters, in partnership with the local government. According to a joint press release issued here Thursday, the inter-agency program to nurture peace, security and decent work through local development in conflict areas of the Philippines will address extreme poverty and inequality as the root causes of social unrest and armed conflict on Bondoc Peninsula, in eastern Quezon province, where natural disasters have affected many people. About 80 per cent of the population in the region depend on farming and fishing activities earning not more than one U.S. dollar per day. \"People cannot get themselves out of poverty without decent work. It is even harder for people living in conflict-affected areas with limited access to livelihood, health care, education and other economic resources,\" said Linda Wirth, Director of the ILO Subregional Office in Manila. Breaking this vicious cycle by bringing stakeholders to work together for local development is crucial to reduce the number of working poor, cope better with climate change and address the root causes of conflict, Linda Wirth said.\n",

In his message for the Day, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed that \"the third Millennium Development Goal -- to achieve gender equality and women's empowerment -- is central to all the rest. When women are denied the opportunity to better themselves and their societies, we all lose.\" \"Until women and girls are liberated from poverty and injustice, all our goals -- peace, security, sustainable development -- stand in jeopardy,\" he added.

      "Full Text of Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009(5). The so-called \"freedom of the press\" of the United States was in fact completely subordinate to its national interests, and was manipulated by the U.S. government. According to media reports, the U.S. government and the Pentagon had recruited a number of former military officers to become TV and radio news commentators to give \"positive comments\" and analysis as \"military experts\" for the U.S. war in Iraq and Afghanistan, in order to guide public opinions, glorify the wars, and gain public support of its anti-terrorism ideology (The New York Times, April 20, 2009). At yearend 2009, the U.S. Congress passed a bill which imposed sanctions on several Arab satellite channels for broadcasting contents hostile to the U.S. and instigating violence (http://blogs.rnw.nl). In September 2009, protesters using the social-networking site Twitter and text messages to coordinate demonstrations clashed with the police several times in Pittsburgh, where the Group of 20 summit was held. Elliot Madison, 41, was later charged with hindering apprehension of the protesters through the Internet. The police also searched his home (http://www.nytimes.com, October 5, 2009). Vic Walczak, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, said the same conduct in other countries would be called human rights violations whereas in the United States it was called necessary crime control. III. On Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Poverty, unemployment and the homeless are serious problems in the United States, where workers' economic, social and cultural rights cannot be guaranteed. Unemployment rate in the U.S. in 2009 was the highest in 26 years. The number of bankrupt businesses and individuals kept rising due to the financial crisis. The Associated Press reported in April 2009 that nearly 1.2 million businesses and individuals filed for bankruptcy in the previous 12 months - about four in every 1,000 people, a rate twice as high as that in 2006 (http://www.floridabankruptcyblog.com). By December 4, 2009, a total of 130 U.S. banks had been forced to close in the year due to the financial crisis (Chicago Tribune, December 4, 2009). Statistics released by the U.S. Labor Department on Nov. 6, 2009 showed unemployment rate in October 2009 reached 10.2 percent, the highest since 1983 (The New York Times, November 7, 2009). Nearly 16 million people were jobless, with 5.6 million, or 35.6 percent of the unemployed, being out of work for more than half a year (The New York Times, November 13, 2009). In September, about 1.6 million young workers, or 25 percent of the total, were jobless, the highest since 1948 when records were kept (The Washington Post, September 7, 2009). In the week ending on March 7, 2009, the continuing jobless claims in the U.S. were 5.47 million, higher than the previous week's 5.29 million (http://247wallst.com, March 19, 2009). The population in poverty was the largest in 11 years. The Washington Post reported on September 10, 2009, that altogether 39.8 million Americans were living in poverty by the end of 2008, an increase of 2.6 million from that in 2007. The poverty rate in 2008 was 13.2 percent, the highest since 1998.  The number of people aged between 18 to 64 living in poverty in 2008 had risen to 22.1 million, 170,000 more than in 2007. Up to 8.1 million families were under poverty, accounting for 10.3 percent of the total families (The Washington Post, September 11, 2009). According to a report of the New York Times on Sept. 29, 2009, the poverty rate in New York City in 2008 was 18.2 percent and nearly 28 percent of the Bronx borough's residents were living in poverty (The New York Times, September 29, 2009). From August 2008 to August 2009, more than 90,000 poor households in California suffered power and gas cuts. A 93-year-old man was frozen to death at his home (http://www.msnbc.msn.com). Poverty led to a sharp rise in the number of suicides in the United States. It is reported that there are roughly 32,000 suicides in the U.S. every year, nearly double the cases of murder, which numbered 18,000 (http://www.time.com). The Los Angeles County coroner's office said the poor economy was taking a toll even on the dead as more bodies in the county went unclaimed by families who could not afford funeral expenses. A total of 712 bodies in Los Angles County were cremated with taxpayers' money in 2008, an increase of 36 percent over the previous year (The Los Angeles Times, July 21, 2009). (more)\n",

We closely integrated sustaining economic growth with economic restructuring, and moved more quickly to resolve structural problems limiting economic development. We further strengthened the work related to agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. The central government used 725.3 billion yuan to support agriculture, rural areas, and farmers, an increase of 21.8%. We raised the minimum grain purchase prices by a large margin. We began implementation of the plan to increase grain production capacity by 50 million tons nationwide. We continued to improve living and working conditions in rural areas. We implemented rural drinking water safety projects that benefited 60.69 million people, increased the number of methane gas users by 5.1 million, built and upgraded 380,000 kilometers of roads and 266,000 kilometers of electric power lines and renovated 800,000 dilapidated houses in the countryside, and helped build permanent housing for 92,000 nomadic families. We also intensified our efforts to fight poverty. As a result, working and living conditions notably improved in poverty- stricken areas. We intensified industrial restructuring. We formulated and implemented a plan for restructuring and invigorating ten key industries. We encouraged enterprises to accelerate technological upgrading, and provided 20 billion yuan to support 4,441 technological upgrading projects. Further progress was made in mergers and reorganization in key industries. We made great efforts to restrict excess production capacity and redundant development in some industries. We closed down 26.17 million kilowatts of small thermal power stations, and eliminated backward facilities with total production capacity of 16.91 million tons in the steelmaking industry, 21.13 million tons in the iron-smelting industry, 74.16 million tons in the cement industry, and 18.09 million tons in the coke industry. We accelerated the implementation of major national science and technology projects, and spent 151.2 billion yuan of central government funds on science and technology, an increase of 30%. We vigorously supported the widespread use of domestically innovated products, and the development of emerging industries such as clean energy and third-generation mobile communications. We vigorously strengthened infrastructure development; put 5,557 kilometers of newly built railway lines into operation; opened 4,719 kilometers of new expressways to traffic, accelerated urban rail development; and built, renovated or expanded 35 civil airports. We increased the installed power- generating capacity by 89.7 million kilowatts, began supplying gas through the western section of the second line of the project for shipping natural gas from west to east, accelerated construction on the South-to- North Water Diversion Project, and began reinforcing 6,183 dangerous reservoirs. We made solid progress in conserving energy, reducing emissions and protecting the environment. We supported 2,983 key energy conservation and recycling projects through budgetary investment. We implemented a project to promote energy-efficient products for the benefit of the people, putting into use more than 5 million energy-saving air-conditioners and 150 million energy-efficient light bulbs. We continued to develop key ecological projects in the forestry industry, and completed the afforestation of 5.88 million hectares, thereby raising the percentage of land covered by forest to 20.36%. Through combined measures, we brought soil erosion on 48,000 square kilometers of land under control. We strengthened the prevention and treatment of water pollution in the key watersheds of the Huai, Hai, and Liao rivers and Tai, Chao, and Dianchi lakes, and improved the control of wastewater, gases and residues from industry. Over the first four years of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period, energy consumption per unit of GDP fell 14.38 %, and chemical oxygen demand and sulfur dioxide emissions decreased 9.66% and 13.14% respectively. We made vigorous efforts to respond to climate change, and set forth our country's targets, policies and measures for controlling greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. We improved our weather forecasting and early warning, as well as earthquake monitoring, and constantly improved our disaster prevention and protection capabilities. We took new steps in balancing development between regions. We thoroughly implemented the overall strategy for regional development, and formulated several major regional development plans and policies. The central and western regions and northeast China accelerated opening up and development, welcomed industries relocated from other parts of the country, and continuously strengthened their foundation for development. The eastern region accelerated restructuring and independent innovation, and the vitality of its economic development increased. A favorable situation emerged in which regional development was better distributed, structured and coordinated.   (More)\n",

We increased education spending nationwide significantly, including central government spending of 198.1 billion yuan, an increase of 23.6%. We comprehensively implemented the urban and rural compulsory education policy, spent 66.6 billion yuan of central government funds on rural compulsory education, and reached the target of raising public spending for rural secondary and primary school students to an average of 500 yuan and 300 yuan per student respectively a year ahead of schedule. We implemented a performance-based pay system for compulsory education teachers. We started to implement the policy of free tuition for rural students attending secondary vocational schools whose families have financial difficulties and students in such schools who are studying agriculture-related majors. We constantly improved the national student financial aid system, which benefited 28.71 million students and basically ensured that no children from poor families were denied schooling due to financial difficulties. We made steady progress in the reform and development of the pharmaceutical and healthcare fields. We organized the implementation of the reform of the pharmaceutical and healthcare systems. The central government spent 127.7 billion yuan on medical and health care, an increase of 49.5 %. A total of 401 million urban workers and non-working urban residents subscribed to basic medical insurance, and coverage of the new type of rural cooperative medical care system reached 830 million people. The central government allocated 42.9 billion yuan to solve the problem of medical insurance for retired workers from closed and bankrupt state-owned enterprises. The basic drug system has been implemented in 30% of primary-level medical and health care institutions. Central government funds were used to support the construction of a number of county-level hospitals, town and township central hospitals, and community health service centers. We launched major public health service projects, including one to increase vaccinations against hepatitis B. We intensified special campaigns for food and drug safety. Faced with the sudden outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), we carried out scientific and orderly prevention and control work in accordance with the law, and thereby effectively protected people's lives and maintained normal order in society. It was not at all easy for our country to make all these achievements against the backdrop of the severe impact of the global financial crisis and the negative growth of the world economy. They were the result of the overall planning and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary as well as the concerted and strenuous efforts of the whole Party, the entire army, and the people of all of our ethnic groups. On behalf of the State Council, I hereby express our sincere gratitude to the people of all of our ethnic groups and to the democratic parties, mass organizations, and people from all sectors of society. I also express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas, as well as to foreign governments, international organizations, and friends in other countries that take an interest in and support China's modernization. In the course of the past year, as we conscientiously applied the Scientific Outlook on Development, vigorously responded to the global financial crisis and completed all of our government work, we came to the following conclusions: We must continue to make use of both market mechanisms and macro-control, that is, at the same time as we keep our reforms oriented toward a market economy, let market forces play their basic role in allocating resources, and stimulate the market's vitality, we must make best use of the socialist system's advantages, which enable us to make decisions efficiently, organize effectively, and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings. We must balance long- and short-term interests, take into account long- and short-term needs, and address both the symptoms and root causes of problems. We must overcome short- term difficulties and solve major problems as well as strengthen key areas and weak links in order to lay a foundation for long-term development. We must continue to consider domestic and international situations, make it a long- term strategic policy to boost domestic demand, adhere to the win-win strategy of opening up, and quickly formulate a pattern in which domestic demand and foreign demand drive economic growth in concert. We must always remember that developing the economy is inseparable from improving people's wellbeing and safeguarding social fairness and justice; make improving people's wellbeing the focus of development, and the starting point, goal, and lasting driving force of economic development; strive to safeguard fairness and justice; ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development; and promote social harmony and stability. We must give free rein to the initiative of both the central and local authorities. While stressing unity of thinking and keeping overall interests in mind, we also need to encourage everyone to proceed in light of local conditions and make explorations and innovations, in order to form a powerful, concerted force for overcoming present difficulties. All of these experiences are of vital and profound significance for keeping to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, improving our ability to run the socialist market economy, and pushing ahead the process of modernization.

The central government allocated 42.6 billion yuan to promote employment, an increase of 59%. An additional 11.02 million urban jobs were created, 2.02 million more than planned. The urban registered unemployment rate stood at 4.3%, thus meeting the target of keeping it under 4.6%. Employment rate for college and university graduates this year was 87.4%. The number of rural migrant workers totaled 145 million, an increase of 4.92 million. Central government spending on social security was 290.575 billion yuan, an increase of 16.6%. Overall planning for basic old-age insurance for workers of urban enterprises at the provincial level was basically accomplished. The methods for transferring old-age pension accounts for workers who move from one region to another were promulgated and implemented. The number of urban residents covered by basic old- age insurance reached 235 million, 7 million more than planned. The pilot program for a new old-age insurance system for rural residents was launched. The basic medical insurance system for non-working urban residents was fully implemented. The problem of medical insurance for retirees from closed or bankrupt SOEs was properly resolved. The number of participants in the basic medical insurance for urban workers and non-working urban residents increased by 82.39 million to exceed 400 million; and the number of rural residents who signed up for the new type of rural cooperative medical care system increased by 16.3 million to reach 833 million. Standards for enterprise retirees' pensions, urban and rural subsistence allowances and subsidies to entitled groups continued to increase. Channels were further expanded for the funding of social security. People's living standards continued to improve. We further developed the infrastructure in urban and rural areas and continually improved our ability to provide services. Supplies of goods and materials were abundant and the market was prosperous and stable. Annual urban per capita disposable income and rural per capita net income reached 17,175 yuan and 5,153 yuan respectively, up 9.8% and 8.5% from the previous year, both in real terms after adjusting for price changes, and 3.8 and 2.5 percentage points higher than planned. Great success was achieved in the current stage of our plan for low-income housing construction. The central government allocated 55.056 billion yuan for this purpose, an increase of 200%. As a result, 2 million units of low-income housing of various types were basically built, and 1.3 million houses were renovated in run- down areas in some cities, in state-owned forest regions and land reclamation zones, and around coalmines, thus improving living conditions for nearly 10 million urban residents experiencing difficulties. We allocated 5.6 billion yuan to work-relief schemes and 1.8 billion yuan to the pilot program for relocating impoverished people from inhospitable areas. These funds supported poor areas in strengthening their ability to develop and poor people in alleviating poverty. Policies for providing ongoing aid to rural residents relocated to make way for the construction of large and medium-sized reservoirs were conscientiously implemented, benefiting 23.56 million relocated people.

But the interim government is facing tremendous challenges in trying to consolidate its power and put the impoverished Central Asian nation onto a right track of development, analysts said. Popular resentment over extreme poverty and moribund socio- economic growth is the main reason behind the collapse of Bakiyev's government, analysts said. About a third of Kyrgyzstan's population now live below the poverty line. Therefore, how to solve the imminent problem of a severe cash shortage and achieve steady economic growth and improve people's livelihood in the longer run is seen as vital to the survival of the new government, which is under mounting pressure to handle the problems of external debts and tight government budgets. The interim government is now in dire need of cash, knowing too well that a new round of unrest could break out if it fails to get enough funds in a short time to cover public wages, pensions and social security programs.\n",

A United Nations report released Thursday urges governments in the Asia-Pacific region to increase social spending to consolidate the region's stronger than anticipated economic rebound and to spur over the long term a fairer, more balanced, and sustained economic recovery. \"Governments must embrace this opportunity to secure the gains of the economic rebound by investing in social programs that directly benefit people hardest hit by the crisis, act to reduce poverty, and create a more sustainable economy,\" Noeleen Heyzer, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP) said at the launch of the report. The report titled \"Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2010\", an annual publication of the ESCAP provides the governments of the Asia-Pacific region - representing 62 percent of the world's population - a roadmap towards a more inclusive and sustainable development path.  However, rising inflationary pressures, especially of food products, and asset price bubbles, in a number of countries make 2010 a complex year for policy makers who will have to balance sustaining the momentum of growth with financial stability. While monetary tightening may be necessary to restrain inflationary pressures, policy makers must be cautious about withdrawing fiscal stimulus packages lest the fledgling recovery process is disrupted. The survey also recommends the use of capital controls to moderate short-term capital inflows - the result of a massive expansion of liquidity in western countries - which has created asset bubbles, inflationary pressures and exchange rate increases in the region's developing economies. \"We know from experience following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis that it may be years before the poorest people are able to recover from the past two years' global crisis; governments need to maintain programs to help people recover their assets and livelihoods,\" said Dr Heyzer.\n",

A further 274,000 children in rural areas will continue to have poor access to safe drinking water, 50,000 adolescents living with HIV/AIDS and 500,000 youths at risk will not receive targeted behavior change advice on prevention, care and treatment, 100,000 orphans will not be able to access protection services and 1,000 children associated with various armed groups will not benefit from demobilization and reintegration programs, said the officials. The most urgent funding priorities amount to 4 million U.S. dollars over the next three months, the officials said. Up to 1 million people have been affected by conflict between government forces and rebels and a spill-over of violence from neighboring countries, mostly in the CAR's northern areas bordering Sudan and Chad.

Under the two-year project, which will be funded by Japan and carried out in the Bouake region, UNIDO will rebuild a center which will offer training in areas such as welding, vehicle mechanics, woodwork, plumbing, building construction, tailoring, healthcare and food nutrition, the officials said. The project is designed \"to assist the Government of Cote d' Ivoire in its efforts towards a lasting peace, poverty eradication and sustainable social and economic development,\" said Yoshiteru Uramoto, the deputy to the director- general of UNIDO. \"Young people, including demobilized combatants, will benefit from a series of training courses,\" he said. \"They will get new skills in the productive sectors, and develop entrepreneurial abilities to set up their own micro-enterprises and income- generating activities.\"\n",

The United Nations on Tuesday expressed its optimism that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) target is achievable as many improvements have even happened in some poorest countries. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his message on the Special Ministerial Meeting for Millennium Development Goals Review in Asia and the Pacific: Run Up to 2015 scheduled on Aug. 3-4 here, said that however the gains have been uneven across the goals and from country to country. \"To date, the global record is mixed. There have been many important gains, but much remains to be done,\" he said in a message delivered by Sha Zukang, UN under secretary for Economic and Social Affairs. Ban said despite the recent food, energy and economic and financial crisis, developing world remain on track to halve poverty from its 1990 level. \"A number of countries have registered major successes in combating hunger, improving school enrollment and child health, expanding access to clean water and HIV treatment, and controlling tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases. These improvements have happened in some of the poorest countries, demonstrating that MDGs are indeed achievable,\" said Ban.\n",

      "Roundup: World accused of neglecting sanitation MDG target. International development organization WaterAid on Wednesday launched a new report to mark the ten year anniversary of the signing of the UN Millennium Declaration. According to WaterAid, governments that signed the declaration are now presiding over populations where billions are living and dying in their own faeces for want of somewhere clean and safe to go to the toilet.    \"The hope embodied in the declaration of 2000 is mired in excrement,\" said WaterAid Policy and Campaigns Director Margaret Batty.   \"The ongoing neglect of the sanitation MDG target represents a damning failure by governments and the aid community to promote an integrated approach to international development.\" The report - Ignored: the biggest child killer – The world is neglecting sanitation - comes just two weeks before world leaders will meet again at the UN to review the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were set out in 2000 to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. At current rates of progress, the 2015 target to halve the proportion of people living without sanitation will not be met globally until 2049; in Sub-Saharan Africa not until the 23rd century, some 200 years late. Drawing on authoritative medical, academic and grassroots sources, the report argues that without sanitation in place the MDGs will not be reached across large parts of the developing world and that the health, education and prosperity of some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people will be severely jeopardized.\n",

      "Full Text: China's Human Resources (2). Optimized employment structure. With China's economic development and industrial structure adjustment, the proportion of those employed in primary industry has dropped significantly while that in tertiary industry has risen greatly. In 2009 the proportion of employment in primary, secondary and tertiary industries changed to 38.1 percent, 27.8 percent, and 34.1 percent from 50 percent, 22.5 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively in 2000. Good progress in talent development. People having professional knowledge or special skills who contribute to society through creative work are highly regarded in China. They are a high- ability and high-quality labor force among human resources. The Chinese government has drawn up and implemented a series of major principles and policies to advance the building of contingents of people of all kinds for the Party and government, enterprise operation and management, professional techniques, high technology, rural affairs and social work in an all-round way. Through years of efforts, the number of talented people has maintained a stable increase, with improved quality, optimized structure and gradually rising utilization efficiency. By the end of 2008 the total number of such people in China had reached 114 million. Gradual improvement of income, health care and social security as guarantees for human resources development. With the country's sustained and rapid socioeconomic development, the income of urban and rural residents has maintained a stable growth. The average disposable income of urban residents increased from less than RMB 100 yuan in 1949 to 15,781 yuan in 2008; and the average net income of rural residents increased from RMB 44 yuan in 1949 to 4,761 yuan in 2008. Great efforts have been mobilized to build up the public health system so as to provide guarantee for improving the health of people nationwide. By the end of 2009 there were 289,000 medical institutions nationwide, 5.22 million medical workers and 3.96 million hospital beds in total. In recent years, the Chinese government has vigorously accelerated the building of the social security system to cover rural and urban residents and to provide basic life assurance for each individual. In 2009, urban basic retirement insurance covered 235.5 million people; the total number of urban employees covered by basic medical insurance, urban residents covered by basic medical insurance and people in the countryside covered by the new rural cooperative medical insurance reached 1.2 billion; unemployment insurance, work- related injury insurance and maternity insurance covered 127.15 million, 148.96 million and 108.76 million people, respectively. China implements a subsistence allowance system. By the end of 2009, 23.477 million urban residents and 47.593 million rural residents had enjoyed subsistence allowances from the government. China has implemented planned and organized large-scale poverty relief programs throughout the country. In 2009, the rural population living in poverty was reduced to 35.97 million, with the nationwide poverty rate dropping to 3.6 percent. II. Legal System for Human Resources Development Adhering to the strategy based on the rule of law, China actively promotes democratic and scientific legislation to provide legal security for the fair and equal rights of individual development for everyone, and the scientific development of human resources. Through years of development, China has established a human resources development legal system with the Constitution as the essential basis, the Labor Law and the Civil Servant Law as the foundation, the Labor Contract Law, the Employment Promotion Law, and the Law on Mediation and Arbitration of Labor Disputes as the main contents, and other separate laws and administrative regulations as major components.

      "Full Text: China's Human Resources (6). The financial aid system has been improved. The Chinese government adopts a national scholarship system, student subsidy system and national student loan system applicable to regular institutions of higher learning and vocational schools. It has provided more financial aid to ensure that students from families with financial difficulties can continue their studies. By the end of 2009 some 90 percent of students from secondary vocational schools and 20 percent of university students had received financial aid on a total of 43.06 million occasions. Since 2009 students from poor rural families studying at secondary vocational schools and students studying agriculture-related subjects in such schools have been exempted from tuitions. Strengthening human resources training The Chinese government has put cadre education and training in a prominent place. The state has drawn up and issued the Regulations on the Work of Cadre Education and Training (Trial), National Plan for Cadre Education and Training (2006-2010) and Opinions on the Implementation of Cadre Training Work on a Large Scale (2008-2012). With focus on the requirements of major government work and civil service posts, the government has conducted initial training, post-related training, professional training and in-service training, carried out training plans geared to the needs of the posts, promoted formal schooling training, and sent cadres to temporary posts in other places, thus effectively developing the human resources of the civil service and promoting career development for civil servants. The Chinese government has carried out the Project on Upgrading the Knowledge of Technical Professionals. The state has, with specific and effective plans and step by step, conducted special training programs on new theories, knowledge, technologies and methods for middle- and high-level professionals in the fields important for economic, social, scientific and technological development. From 2005 to 2009, altogether three million middle- and high-level professionals participated in such training programs. The government has worked hard to build a continuing education system for technical specialists, a system that sets clear levels and categories, and that brings into full play the initiative of all aspects, gradually forming a demand-driven, continuing education mechanism characterized by the combination of the government guidance and employers' initiative, individuals' fulfillment of their duties and studying on their own initiative. In 2009 professionals involved in continuing education around China reached 30 million person/times. To promote human resources development in Western China, the Chinese government issued the Opinions on Strengthening Human Resources Development in Western China and carried out a training plan for the backbone personnel in the scientific and technological field in the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions, and for professionals in the Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai Province. In 2009 China trained 2,888 backbone scientific and technical personnel and much-needed professionals of ethnic-minority groups. To meet the demands of different groups in finding employment, and geared to different stages of careers, the government has conducted vocational training programs, set up a vocational training system with technical schools as the mainstay and vocational training institutions as the supplement, and given full play to the roles of trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's federation, and other mass and social organizations. By the end of 2009 there were over 6,000 technical schools and employment training centers, over 20,000 privately- run vocational training institutions, and over 260,000 demonstration bases of science and technology for women, providing different education and training programs for women on 120 million occasions and enhancing women's capability of self-development. For junior and senior high school graduates who have failed to gain higher education, the government offers pre-job training courses to help them master some vocational skill or obtain a professional certificate before job hunting. For unemployed people, the government offers re-employment training courses that are relevant, practical and effective, so as to better prepare unemployed people for re-employment. For urban and rural workers who want to start businesses of their own and who have the qualifications, the government offers entrepreneurship training courses to enhance their abilities to start small businesses. For surplus rural workers who want to transfer to non- agricultural fields and urban areas, the government offers vocational training and carries out such special programs as the Sunshine Project, Training Plan for the Transfer of Rural Labor Force, Spark Technical Training and Yulu Plan to enhance their abilities to find employment in new sectors.

Daniel Ooko NAIROBI, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- East Africa will face more devastating food crises in future unless governments take action now, international aid agency Oxfam warned on Thursday as it released a new report aimed at tackling world hunger within the next five years. The report, \"Halving World Hunger: Still Possible\", is launched as East African leaders prepare to join the rest of the world in New York next week to review progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the first of which is to halve world hunger by 2015. According to Oxfam, that goal is well off track but the report argues that halving hunger is still possible if countries take the lead with the right policies and invest in agriculture, food security, social protection, and projects that prepare communities in advance for disasters and mitigate their impact. \"The improved situation this year is more down to good luck than good judgment. Another bad rainy season or failed harvest could see the region plunged back into crisis,\" Leo Roozendaal, Oxfam's Acting Regional Director, said.  \"Governments must do much more to address the underlying causes of hunger in the region, such as decades of under-investment in agriculture, chronic neglect of the most vulnerable communities, and the growing threat of climate change.\" The Kenyan government has announced plans to introduce cash transfers for families in the poorest urban areas, a measure Oxfam hopes will soon be implemented as it would help give people the flexibility to cope with hunger.\n",

The unbalanced progresses among different countries and regions, as well as challenges brought by the world financial and economic crisis, are endangering the agreed actions on combating poverty and raising living standards. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), eight internationally agreed targets that aim to reduce poverty, hunger, maternal and child deaths, disease, inadequate shelter, gender inequality and environmental degradation by 2015, were established in 2000. Since then there have been improvement in all aspects, but countries vary in realizing their respective promises. Take the key anti-poverty effort official development assistance (ODA) for example. Developed countries promised 30 years ago to devote 0.7 percent of GDP to helping poor countries, but up to date only Denmark, Luxemburg, Holland, Norway and Sweden have achieved normal standard set by UN.\n",

The goals were first set at the Millennium Summit in 2000, and are due to be achieved by 2015.

It focused particularly on actions, policies and strategies to support those developing countries that are lagging most behind and those goals that are most off track, thus improving the lives of the poorest people.\n",

Secretary for Labor and Welfare of the Hong Kong government, Matthew Cheung, said Wednesday the city aims to have the statutory minimum wage regime implemented in the first half of next year. Cheung said the city's Provisional Minimum Wage Commission will soon submit its recommendation on the initial wage rate to the government for consideration. \"A minimum wage will not eradicate poverty, but will go a long way towards easing the difficulties of the working poor. Gone will be the days of blatant exploitation through paying excessively low wages,\" he said. Cheung said the minimum wage bill, passed two months ago, sets an optimal minimum hourly wage to forestall excessively low pay without unduly affecting labor market flexibility, economic growth and competitiveness. The city's 60-member Legislative Council passed the Minimum Wage bill on July 17, which aims to establish an optimal statutory minimum wage regime to forestall excessively low wages without unduly affecting labor market flexibility, economic growth and competitiveness or causing significant loss in low-paid jobs.\n",

      "Full Text: Progress in China's Human Rights in 2009 (6). Judicial transparency has increased. In 2009 the Supreme People's Court issued the Six Provisions on Judicial Openness, which applies the principle of openness to every procedure of trial and law enforcement, improves the regulations on the release of judgment documents on the Internet and live broadcast of court hearings, requires openness of the judicial process and results, adopts a regular press-release system, and expands the scope and depth of judicial openness. In the same year, the Supreme People's Court enacted the Disciplinary Regulations for Staff Members of People's Courts. On the basis of this ordinance, 795 staff members of people's courts at all levels were investigated and punished for breaches of law or discipline. Among them, 137 were transferred to judicial organs for investigation. A total of 303,000 letters voicing grievances from ordinary people were addressed by the courts and 1,055,000 complainants were received. The legal aid system has achieved remarkable results, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of people with financial difficulties. In June 2009 the Ministry of Justice organized activities with the theme  \"Legal aid services for the convenience of the people,\"  and promoted ten measures nationwide to help ordinary people with legal affairs. The coverage of legal aid has been expanded throughout the country, and issues including health care, employment, education, work remuneration and social security which are closely related to the people's well-being have been incorporated as supplements into the coverage of legal aid for the protection of citizens' rights and interests. More and more regions in China have adjusted the \"financial difficulty level\" to 1.5 to 2 times the minimum living standard of the region in question so that more people with financial difficulties can enjoy the benefit of legal aid. The legal aid network is being continuously consolidated. By the end of 2009 some 3,274 legal aid organizations and 58,031 legal aid service centers had been set up at the provincial, city and county levels nationwide, providing convenient access to legal aid services. In 2009, over 640,000 legal aid cases were handled, and legal consultancy services were extended to 4.84 million people, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of people with financial difficulties. The role of lawyers in protecting human rights through judicial means has been increasingly strengthened. In 2009 China formulated regulations and rules in this respect, specifying relevant stipulations in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Lawyers. These detailed regulations facilitate the implementation of stipulations in the Law on lawyers' rights to consult with clients, to read case records, and to investigate and collect evidence, advancing the development of litigation on the part of lawyers and creating a strong legal guarantee for lawyers to carry out their responsibilities and play a larger role in judicial procedures. In 2009 lawyers throughout the country undertook over 1.96 million litigation cases of all types, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of their clients and promoting judicial justice. The legal rights and interests of people in detention and prison are protected by law. In 2009 the Ministry of Justice enacted and implemented the Assessment Measures for the Work on the Rehabilitation of Criminals in Prison to popularize the performance assessment system of rehabilitation work in an all- round way. It also carried out a campaign focusing on \"regulating law enforcement actions and raising the level of law enforcement\" in an attempt to solve the problems in law enforcement. A rehabilitation mode of \"5+1+1,\" namely five days of rehabilitation through labor and one day of classroom education, plus one day of rest every week has been widely adopted in prisons. Measures have been taken to ensure that prisoners' standard of living and health care levels always keep up with the country's social and economic development. In 2009 the procuratorial organs urged the correction of the excessive detention of 337 people, and put forward rectification opinions on 22,268 cases of unlawful actions. In the same year the procuratorial organs joined hands with the public security organs in launching a special inspection of supervision and law enforcement at detention houses throughout China. This campaign discovered and punished 2,207 prisoners who bullied other inmates, and 123 of them were prosecuted for their acts involving criminal offences. The procuratorial organs and the Ministry of Justice jointly carried out a campaign to \"check for possible hidden dangers of accidents and improve the safety of detention houses and prisons.\"  As a result improvement was made in safety measures and supervision work in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of criminals. Meanwhile, the people's mediation system has been strengthened. By the end of 2009 a total of 823,000 people's mediation committees with 4,938,000 mediators from among ordinary people had been established throughout China. In 2009 these committees mediated 7,676,000 disputes, prevented 48,000 civil disputes from escalating into criminal cases, and stopped 18,000 people from committing suicide in civil dispute cases.

The Ugandan government announced on Monday that starting April next year it will start paying a monthly stipend to the chronically poor in a five-year 40 million pounds ( about 64 million U.S. dollars) pilot project. George Bekunda, the director of social protection in the Ministry of Gender and Social Development, told reporters here that over 600,000 people in 95,000 households will benefit from the program dubbed Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE). The grants will be paid to two categories of people namely the old age grants payable to elderly citizens above 65 years and the vulnerable grants payable to labor constrained households such as those headed by disabled, orphans and widows. Bekunda said the SAGE project mainly funded by the British development aid agency, Department for International Development (DFID), will target households which can not benefit from the poverty alleviation programs set up by the Ugandan government. If the project is successful it will be rolled out through out the East African country from the initial 14 districts, according to Bekunda.\n",

This statement came as Ghanaian Foreign Minister Alhaj Muhammad Mumuni addressed the annual general debate of the 65th session of the UN General Assembly, which entered its fifth day here. \"While the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger is a major development challenge facing Africa, most countries in the region are also grappling with the problems of climate change, high disease burden, poor infrastructure, brain drain and the lack of development of productive capacity,\" Mumuni said. These \"multiple crises,\" he said also jeopardize efforts by African countries to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs), the eight anti-poverty targets to be achieved by its deadline of 2015. \"We need a renewed spirit of solidarity and commitment for a comprehensive global response to confront the challenges of our time,\" Mumuni said.\n",

      "EU integrates disaster risk reduction in aid actions. European Commission reiterated on Wednesday the importance to include measures for reducing disaster risks in aid program. On the occasion of the International Day for Disaster Reduction, the European Commission stressed on Wednesday it is very important to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction in its worldwide humanitarian and development actions. More than 160 natural disasters occurred in the first half of 2010, killing worldwide around 230,000 people, affecting 107 million others and causing more than 40 billion euros (around 56 billion U.S. dollars) of damages. These figures, which do not even take into account the terrible floods in Pakistan, show the importance of supporting disaster risk reduction measures. According to the commission, disaster risk reduction and better preparation can save lives, speed up recovery, but can also reduce the impact of future hazards and contribute to long-term development goal. \"Funds spent on helping communities prepare before a disaster strikes are three to four times more effective than funds directed at response to a catastrophe,\" Commissioner Georgieva declared on Wednesday.\n",

The EU said the global community had promised to ensure that every citizen has enough food everyday by 2015, the first of the eight Millennium Development Goals, but hunger still affects far too many people and it kills more than 3 million children annually. It was estimated that almost a billion people lack reliable access to food, most of them living in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Their situation is getting even worse in the financial and economic crisis. The EU is the world's biggest provider of development aid. Between 2007 and 2009, it allocated over 850 million euros (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to humanitarian food assistance operations targeting the most vulnerable people in more than 40 countries worldwide, according to EU figures.\n",

With 1.3 million people still living in spontaneously formed camps nine months after a massive earthquake that devastated Haiti, a United Nations expert on Tuesday called for a shift in the focus of humanitarian operations and more urgency in launching the reconstruction process. \"Haiti is still living through a profound humanitarian crisis that affects the human rights of those displaced by the disaster,\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon's Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Walter Kaelin said after a visit to the small island country, noting that camp residents include both those who lost their homes and others fleeing poverty exacerbated by the January quake, which killed more than 200,000 people. \"Visiting some of the capital's worst slum areas, I also met many others outside camps, whose plight was less visible, but not less grave,\" he said. \"People in the camps have specific needs, especially relating to shelter, which need to be addressed at the camp level.\" \"However, other urgent needs such as access to health, water, sanitation and education faced not only by the camp population but also by Haiti's poor should be addressed through a neighborhood approach,\" he said. \"That way, the entire affected population has equal access in accordance with needs and people are not drawn into unsustainable camps.\" Calling for more urgency for reconstruction process, Kaelin said the crisis needs a development solution, with the government facing the primary responsibility to communicate publicly a plan on how to provide durable solutions, while donors ensure early recovery funding for smaller-scale neighborhood reconstruction to begin.\n",

This call was made by the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF)at a national seminar held Thursday here in Bangladesh capital Dhaka for the launch of its two documents: UNICEF global report \"Progress for Children: Achieving MDGS with equity\" and \" Mitigating socio-economic inequalities to accelerate poverty reduction: Investing in vulnerable children\". New UNICEF study shows despite progress in many areas of social and economic sectors, child poverty and socio-economic disparities in Bangladesh remain a grave concern. More than 30 million children live below the upper poverty line and one-quarter lives in extreme poverty while they are deprived of basic social needs, it also showed. Based on these findings, UNICEF suggests that investing in poor and vulnerable children should become a key priority component of Bangladesh's development strategy.\n",

Speaking at the official launch of the child labor research and actions programs, the ministry's Permanent Secretary Taito Waqa hailed fee free education, the abolishment of external examinations in primary and lower secondary schools, free transport to students who qualify under a means test, provisions of education facilities to non-government schools and the creation of the parallel skill board for Technical Vocational Education Training in schools as measures which support the vision to eradicate child labor in Fiji. Waqa said the Fiji government reiterated its poverty alleviation policies, which were reflected in the increase allocation for assistance towards poverty alleviation in 2011 to 70 million Fijian dollars (about 37.84 million US dollars), compared to 54 million Fijian dollars in 2010.   \"For example, the allocations of free bus fare and food voucher programs are 12 million and 11 million Fijian dollars respectively with a cash grant of 40 to 60 Fijian dollars per child per month will be paid in respect of orphans,\" he added.
