Two senior officials of government have recommended the relocation of millions of Chinese as a better way to remove them from abject poverty than expensive development schemes. The organization of migrant workers and relocation of households would serve better in China's campaign to lift its remaining 26.1 million people out of absolute poverty, insisted Liu Jinqi, deputy director of foreign affairs office of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Government. Asked by Xinhua to comment on the achievements of the 25-year state-backed poverty eradication campaign in northwest China, Liu said,    ""Poverty eradication is getting more difficult day by day and the progress in lifting people out of poverty is slowing noticeably."" Wang Guoliang, deputy head of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, also said poverty eradication for 26.1 million Chinese in abject poverty would be extremely difficult as their living environments were execrable, with poor conditions for agriculture, backward infrastructure and social underdevelopment. ""I don't think the conventional methods of eradicating poverty, such as the launch of development projects with large amounts of funding, will produce the desired effect,"" said Wang.","{'workers', 'poverty eradication', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.6567987521033232

Rights (5). Q. Great changes have taken place in the present-day international human rights. How do you view the present situation in this field? How do you think the world human rights cause can develop healthily? A. There are two prominent features in the current international human rights situation. One is that the international community has never attached such great importance to human rights as at present and human rights have become an important subject in international exchange and cooperation. Since the end of the Cold War, human rights issues have become increasingly important in international relations and international politics. With the rapid growth of economic globalization and informationization of social life, countries have become increasingly inter-dependent and mutually cooperative, thus accentuating the importance of human rights issues. Countries have attached more and more importance to human rights issues and reached more and more common understanding on these issues. In March 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, deciding to set up the Human Rights Council under it to replace the Human Rights Commission affiliated to the UN Economic and Social Council. This shows that human rights have for the first time been juxtaposed with security and development as the ""three main pillars"" of the UN. In recent years, some countries have, according to the UN requirements, set up national human rights organizations such as national human rights commissions, thus putting the promotion and protection of human rights in a more important position. The second is that it has become a common call to have dialogue and oppose confrontation, making those who use human rights to create confrontation be more and more unpopular. All this represents progress and development in the area of international human rights. However, what cannot be ignored is that there are still factors of disharmony in the development of world human rights and there are still stiff challenges. For instance, as the new international political and economic order has not been established and the world economic development is still very uneven, and the South-North gaps continue to grow, the rights to survival and development of the people of developing countries are being seriously threatened. Some countries and regional groups have politicized and ideologized human rights by practicing double standards, flying the ""human rights"" flag to negate the sovereignty of other countries and carry out hegemonism and power politics, thus seriously spoiling the atmosphere of international cooperation in and obstructing the healthy development of human rights in the world. I think that to seek healthy development of human rights in the world, we must, first of all, face up to the prominent problems in the present-day world and rise up to safeguard the rights to survival and development of the people of all countries. At present, armed conflicts and other traditional security problems still exist; non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and environmental pollution have become more and more prominent, seriously threatening the innocent lives of millions of people. The South-North and poor-rich gaps have been further enlarged, with the developed countries with a population of less than 20 percent of the world's total controlling more than 85 percent of the global wealth while developing countries with more than 80 percent of the world's population enjoying less than 15 percent of the wealth of the world. There are more than one billion people in developing countries who are still suffering from poverty, hunger and diseases. Their survival and dignity have been seriously threatened. Only by rooting out the factors that seriously threaten and sabotage human rights, can the rights of the people of all countries be realized. Secondly, it is imperative to integrate the universality of human rights with the national conditions of various countries. All people of all countries should enjoy freedom and equality. This is the universal pursuit and common ideal of mankind. But, restrained by economic development level, cultural traditions and social systems, people have different understandings and demands with regard to human rights and their human rights problems that need priority solution also vary. Under the precondition of recognizing the universality of human rights, all governments and people have the right to adopt different policy measures and ways and means according to their respective national conditions to seek models and paths for human rights development best suited to their national conditions. The diversification of human rights development models not only fully reflects the diversity of civilizations and the wisdom and intelligence of the people of all countries, but also enriches and develops the human rights theories and practice in the world. Respect for the diversity of the human rights development models not only means respect for the national conditions of all countries, the wisdom and creativity of their people, the diversity of civilizations and ways of living, but also constitutes the important precondition for human rights development in the world.","{'control', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor', 'human rights'}",0.5958860426859701

He said therefore it would be a tragic omission if Asia did not place poverty eradication at the top of its agenda.

NYT_ENG_19990512.0487,"ECONOMIC SCENE: MANEUVERING MINIMUM WAGE BANDWAGON CAREFULLY. Congress will almost certainly raise the minimum wage this year, probably to $6.15 an hour from $5.15, phased in over two to three years. Democrats, as always, are in full support. So, too, are at least 20 moderate House Republicans anxious about next year's election. But whatever the political attraction, does a higher minimum wage make economic sense? A growing number of economists say yes, though there is reason for Congress to move cautiously, perhaps even creatively. The main purpose for raising the minimum wage is to make it possible for all full-time workers to earn enough to lift their families out of poverty. The current minimum wage falls short. By 2000, according to calculations by Isaac Shapiro of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the combination of earnings at $5.15 an hour, $3,600 in food stamps and the earned income tax credit _ a provision of the tax code that has the Treasury send a check of up to $3,880 to low-wage workers _ would bring the annual income of a family of four to about $16,100: $1,400 short of the poverty line. But at a wage of $6.15, the family would fall short by about only $450. Critics, like Prof. David Neumark of Michigan State, say further increases in the minimum wage would make some low-wage workers too expensive to hire. Teen-agers are especially vulnerable. Neumark concludes, ``the net effect of minimum wages is an increase in the proportion of poor families.'' Other critics say that the minimum wage showers help on the wrong people, for example, teen-agers from wealthy families.","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'poor'}",0.5706621004088297

Rights (4). Q. Just as you have mentioned that China has made great achievements in the human rights cause since reform and opening up, but there are still some problems and difficulties that cannot be ignored. As far as the present is concerned, what problems and difficulties do you think still exist in the human rights cause? What is the prospect of the development of human rights in China? A. Human rights are a development process. China is a developing country with a population of 1.3 billion. Due to natural, historical, cultural and economic and social factors, there are still many problems and difficulties in the development of human rights. There are quite a few things less than satisfactory in the human rights conditions in the country. For instance, the political and economic structural systems are yet to be improved; democracy and the legal system remain to be perfected; governments at all levels have to heighten their awareness about protecting human rights and about exercising administration according to law; the economic and social development is uneven and the enlarging gaps between the urban and rural areas, between different regions, and between the rich and the poor have not been brought under control; problems and difficulties are quite outstanding in such areas as employment, social security, income distribution, education, medical service, housing and production safety. All this will affect the immediate interests and rights of the people. It is, therefore, a long-term and arduous task of the Chinese government and people to continue and strengthen their efforts to promote and protect human rights. Despite all these difficulties and problems, I am still fully confident of the prospects of human rights development. First of all, China has put human rights high on the agenda for national development. Running through the entire report to the 17th CPC National Congress are such terms as ""people first,"" improvement of people's livelihood, expansion of democracy and protection of human rights. The report stressed the importance of respecting and protecting human rights and ensuring the rights of all members of the society to equal participation and equal development. The report made a clarion call for improving the democratic system, diversifying the forms of democracy and expanding democratic channels, and ""protecting the people's right to know, right to participation, right to expression and right to oversight."" It also called for acceleration of social construction focusing on the improvement of the livelihood of the people, ""promoting social justice and equity, striving to enable all the people to have school to attend when in need, get due income from labor, have access to due medical treatment when falling ill, get proper care when in old age and have decent and adequate housing."" The 11th five-year development program, from its guidelines, principles, goals to concrete policy measures, is a full expression of the requirements of ""people first,"" scientific development and social harmony. This has charted a clear orientation for the all-round development of human rights. Secondly, over the past 30 years of reform and opening up, China has pioneered a new path best suited to its national conditions in human rights development, which features ""people first,"" stability as precondition, reform as the motive force, development as the key, the rule of law as the guarantee, and comprehensive and coordinated development in the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. So long as we continue along this path, China's human rights cause is sure to see new progress as the modernization drive goes on. I firmly believe that so long as we unswervingly implement the constitutional principle of respecting and protecting human rights, constantly improve democracy and the rule of law, our society will become more harmonious and people will live a still better life and enjoy human rights to the full.

He said many countries are reversing policy bias against agriculture in order to stimulate balanced, sustainable economic development with equity. But, the population growth suggests that undernutrition and hunger in many countries, particularly in Africa, will continue to be ""unacceptably high.""

Stressing that the accord ``is just the beginning,'' he added, ``We know sweatshop labor will not vanish overnight.'' He called for ``more companies to join this crusade and follow its strict rules of conduct.'' The voluntary agreement, reached after eight months of negotiations, bars the use of prison and other forced labor and prohibits the employment of children under 15 in most nations, or 14 where the country's law allows. It recognizes the right of workers to ``freedom of association and collective bargaining'' and generally requires adherence to local laws on wages and working hours. It stipulates that workers be paid ``at least the minimum wage . . . or the prevailing industry wage, whichever is higher'' and generally limits the work week to 60 hours ``except in extraordinary business circumstances.''","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'working conditions', 'child labor', 'human rights'}",0.3938749496954682

Half the adults in Britain who are "" poor"" are homeowners and thus receive little or no state help, says research published on Wednesday. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation responsible for the survey said it challenged the fundamental belief that home ownership in the United Kingdom  equated with wealth, and urged the government to rethink its benefits policy as a result of its findings. The research found that two-thirds of mortgage holders and 18 percent of home buyers who owned their property outright were classed as poor. Mortgage holders were more likely to live in poverty if they were young, aged between 24 and 35, were manual workers, out of work, lone parents, or came from a black or ethnic minority group. Among homeowners, families with children living at home or university were most likely to be the poorest, said the research.

NYT_ENG_20000219.0143,"EDITORIAL: THE INVISIBLE CHILDREN. The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 20: If there is a political issue that has stirred young people in America in recent years, it is the exploitation of child labor overseas. College students have organized to ensure that their university's athletic wear is not sewn by children. Elementary school classes have petitioned Disney and Nike to keep children out of their factories. Because of consumer clout and the importance of reputation to American manufacturers, child labor in their factories overseas has indeed diminished. The problem of child labor, however, goes far beyond the tennis shoe. A quarter-billion children 14 and under work worldwide. UNICEF estimates that fewer than 1 in 20 make goods for export _ and those who do are the most fortunate working children. The vast majority are employed in far more harmful occupations. Children in agriculture are poisoned by pesticides. Prostitutes get AIDS. Miners and glassworkers inhale dangerous substances. Shoe shiners and gum sellers are at the mercy of the streets. Domestic servants live in isolation and suffer beatings and sexual abuse. Millions of children in South Asia are sold by their parents into bonded labor to work off family debts. American consumers are right to insist that the goods we buy are not made by exploited children. But these efforts will backfire if children kicked out of these factories drift to more hazardous occupations. Helping children in these dangerous jobs _ where they are isolated and invisible, and have no champions overseas _ is far more complex than keeping them out of factories. Fortunately, the Clinton administration is taking a sophisticated and constructive approach. Earlier this month the White House proposed doubling Washington's spending to fight child labor. The child labor division of the International Labor Organization, which is based in Geneva, would get $45 million next year, up from $30 million this year and only $3 million three years ago. Washington is now by far the group's largest and most influential donor. An additional $55 million would go to U.S. programs overseas. Both efforts would attempt to provide the most effective antidote to child labor _ schooling. The vast majority of child labor occurs in places with high levels of rural poverty and lax legal enforcement. Virtually every country bans hazardous child labor and most underage labor. In most nations, however, poor enforcement leaves children to be exploited by employers _ who often prefer to hire children because they are cheaper and more docile workers than adults. But economic development and effective law enforcement are not likely any time soon. For now, the best way to reduce child labor is to make primary education cheaper, better and more accessible.","{'workers', 'child labor', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.3896375611745424

Parliament on Sunday took up measures meant to bring Chinese law into line with a more open, capitalist-style economy by protecting private property and equalizing taxes for foreign and domestic companies. The proposed property law is the most controversial measure to come before parliament in recent years. Earlier versions prompted an outcry by leftists, who complained it would undermine state control of the economy and worsen the growing gap between an elite who have profited from China's reforms and the poor majority. The National People's Congress began considering a seventh draft on Sunday that ""strikes a balance between private property and state ownership,"" said the official Xinhua News Agency. It said backers hoped to pass it when the NPC holds its next full meeting in March.

That followed two decades of reform that let hundreds of millions of Chinese lift themselves out of poverty as entrepreneurs started businesses, bought homes and traded stocks.

LTW_ENG_20050922.0010,"Measuring Development. The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: This weekend's meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund take place as interest in the problems of poor countries grows. In the past few years, the annual summits of the Group of Eight industrialized nations have focused repeatedly on Africa; this year's gathering was preceded by consciousness-raising Live 8 concerts in several cities. The stalled current round of global trade talks is also supposed to be about poverty reduction. The United Nations' worthy Millennium Development Goals have been endorsed even by a skeptical Bush administration, which threatened to blow up the recent U.N. summit over this issue but then backed down when it became clear that just about every other country in the world regards the goals as sacrosanct. Unfortunately, the new enthusiasm for helping poor countries is not always properly channeled. The Live 8 concerts, for example, were focused on debt relief, a subject that will loom large again at the World Bank-IMF meetings. But debt relief will save poor countries a tiny amount relative to what they can expect by way of aid. Equally, aid gets more attention than other policies that may matter more. Immigration policy is one example: The money sent home by workers from poor countries who hold jobs in the rich world comes to more than all official aid budgets combined, and the correlation between remittances and poverty reduction appears to be stronger than the correlation between aid and poverty reduction. Likewise, aid probably matters less than trade policy, too. In May, amid much fanfare, Congress approved $908 million in aid for four of the countries affected by the Dec. 26 tsunami, but the United States raises twice that amount each year by taxing imports from those countries. To make development policy effective, the rich world needs to take a broad view of its interactions with poor countries, factoring in not only aid, trade and migration but also contributions to the poor world's military security, environmental prospects and access to investment capital and useful technology. As it happens, the work of meshing these disparate policies into one analytical framework has already been done: For the past three years, the Center for Global Development in Washington has scored 21 rich countries' contributions in each of these categories and published the results in Foreign Policy magazine. This Commitment to Development Index could be the benchmark against which development promises are measured. The latest index confirms that policies toward the poor world are improving slowly. The end of global quotas on textiles and clothing imports, together with extra aid, has pushed the average score in the index up from last year. The index ranks Denmark as the most pro-development nation, reflecting its steady contribution to U.N. peacekeeping, trade openness and environmental controls as well as a large aid budget relative to the size of its economy. The United States, which scores well on trade, investment and security but abysmally on aid, comes in 12th overall. Japan is at the bottom.","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.36448422607180797

 Papademetriou directs the International Migration Policy 
 Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.. In the flare-up of concern for deaf-mute Mexicans found working under conditions of near-enslavement, an important lesson about our approach to controlling illegal immigration is being lost. Namely, penalizing employers for hiring unauthorized workers is a far less effective tool than strengthening the enforcement of existing labor laws, such as minimum wage and overtime rules, child labor restrictions, occupational health and safety rules and civil and human rights standards. The public's horrified reaction to this incident has shown again that Americans are more outraged at exploitative labor practices than they are at the simple hiring of illegal immigrants. Yet our public policies go in exactly the opposite direction. We seem to be concentrating almost exclusively on employer sanctions -- to the point of moving into the uncharted waters of a national identification system. This approach gives rise to the very situation we are now recoiling from: the growth in underground networks providing unscrupulous employers with undocumented workers too ignorant of their rights and too intimidated to insist on them. Outlawing the hiring of unauthorized workers is a necessary part of a comprehensive illegal immigration control effort. It should not, however, be the centerpiece of our overall interior enforcement strategy. That role belongs to the enforcement of employment standards and other workplace rules. An increase of 250 Department of Labor compliance officers would take on the additional duties effectively. The Immigration and Naturalization Service could be left to focus on its principal enforcement missions: controlling the border, intercepting organized smuggling and ferreting out and deporting criminal immigrants. Failing to follow this prescription makes us appear much more concerned about the employment of unauthorized workers than about exploitive working conditions that erode the security of all workers.","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'control', 'working conditions', 'child labor', 'human rights'}",0.36380756446845763

In four of the last five years, there has been no harvest and millions of poor farmers are living in a state of hunger, poor health and illiteracy that in some areas approaches the deprivation levels of China's great famine in the late 1950s. Muslim villagers here in southern Ningxia, known as the Hui Autonomous Region, say that no official from the Xiji County government, 20 miles away, has ever hiked into this desperately poor hamlet to offer assistance to the peasants, most of whom cannot afford to send their children to school and for whom medical care is nonexistent. To add to their misery this fall, a plague of rats has come down from the mountains to feed on the pitifully small potato crop that sprouted after the blessing of a late summer rain and is all that will keep hunger at bay this winter. This year, a farmer named He Delin put it ruefully, ``Our life is potatoes.'' Although China has made prodigious efforts under Communist rule to eradicate poverty, lifting tens if not hundreds of millions to a higher standard of living through the economic reforms led by the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, since 1978, from 60 million to 100 million Chinese still live on the edge of starvation and despair.

LTW_ENG_20060509.0098,"Fighting Poverty With the Right Aid. The developing world often seems like highway traffic. Countries such as China, India and Chile are in a slipstream of rapid economic growth, closing the technological gap with the industrialized countries, while nations such as Nepal, Niger and Sudan are rushing in the reverse direction, with rising unrest, confrontation, drought and disease. The costs of the economic failures are enormous for the whole world because conflicts, terrorism, the drug trade and refugees spill across national borders. But drivers can change direction, and so can countries. India, China and Chile were hardly success stories in the 1960s and 1970s. All were in turmoil, beset by poverty, hunger and political instability. Their economic transformations show that today's ``basket cases'' can be tomorrow's emerging markets. Those who contend that foreign aid does not work -- and cannot work -- are mistaken. These skeptics make a career of promoting pessimism by pointing to the many undoubted failures of past aid efforts. But the fact remains that we can help ensure the successful economic development of the poorest countries. We can help them escape from poverty. It's in our national interest to do so. The first step out of rural poverty almost always involves a boost in food production to end cycles of famine. Asia's ascent from poverty in the last 40 years began with a ``green revolution.'' Food yields doubled or tripled. The Rockefeller Foundation helped with the development and propagation of high-yield seeds, and U.S. aid enabled India and other countries to provide subsidized fertilizer and seeds to impoverished farmers. Once farmers could earn an income, they could move on to small-business development. A second step out of poverty is an improvement in health conditions, led by improved nutrition, cleaner drinking water and more basic health services. In the Asian success stories, child mortality dropped sharply, which, in turn, led to smaller families because poor parents gained confidence that their children would survive to adulthood.","{'famine', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor'}",0.35650395746646063

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's richest charity, joined with the Rockefeller Foundation Tuesday to launch a new development initiative for sub-Saharan Africa that they said would revolutionize food production and reduce hunger and poverty for tens of millions of people. Modeled on the Rockefeller-pioneered ``green revolution'' that transformed farming methods and staved off widespread famine in much of the developing world nearly a half-century ago, the initiative coincides with a new round of Western concern about the long-intractable problems of the poorest continent. Home to 16 of the 18 most undernourished countries, Africa is the only part of the world where food production has decreased in recent years. At the same time, political upheaval and conflict there are seen as fertile ground for extremists. Widespread famine in Africa has spurred recurring outbursts of high-profile relief efforts over the years, from United Nations programs to celebrity fund-raising concerts such as Live Aid in the 1980s and Live 8 last year. Sponsors of the new ``Alliance for a Green Revolution'' said Tuesday they are looking for a more systematic, long-term solution to African hunger. The alliance is the first Gates venture into poverty and development after years of focusing largely on global health and education. The effort follows a doubling of the foundation's $30 billion endowment, drawn largely from Gates' Microsoft Corp. fortune, with investment guru Warren Buffett donating an additional $31 billion earlier this year. Gates has said that he will step down from direct management of Microsoft in 2008 to work full time on foundation activities.","{'famine', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor'}",0.35173501950755354

Ko Gyoung-bin, director general of the Unification Ministry's office handling the industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong, said the minimum take-home pay for the approximately 6,800 North Korean workers is US$35 (euro28) a month for a 48-hour work week _ much higher than the average income elsewhere in the impoverished communist country.

By Eric Schlosser=Special to the Los Angeles Times= Migrant farm workers have long been among the poorest workers in the United States. The typical migrant is a 29-year-old Mexican-born male whose annual income is less than $7,500. He is likely to be here illegally, especially if he is among the poorest of the poor, those who pick fruits and vegetables by hand. And he is ripe for exploitation. In California -- where over the last two decades some farm wages, adjusted for inflation, have declined by about 50 percent -- this is a familiar tale. But in the fields of Florida, wages and working conditions are even worse. To earn the federal minimum wage picking tomatoes in southern Florida, a migrant has to pick more than 320 pounds an hour. That's more than a ton in an eight-hour day. In the fields near Immokalee, Fla., where much of the state's tomato industry is situated, a new form of indentured servitude flourishes. Illegal immigrants have been forced to work for below minimum wage to pay off their debts to people-smugglers and labor contractors. Since the mid-1990s the Justice Department has successfully prosecuted five cases of slavery in the region. The close relationship between Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and that state's agricultural interests guarantees that little will be done at the state level to remedy the situation. And that is why a growing national movement insists that the multinational corporations that buy Florida's produce must take responsibility for how migrant workers are being treated.","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'working conditions', 'slavery', 'poor'}",0.3378676977691706

The vast majority of the ethnic groups inhabit underdeveloped areas in west China.

LTW_ENG_20050808.0059,"The Next Chinese Threat. Last week congressional bullying drove China to abandon its bid for Unocal, a small California-based oil company. Anyone inclined to celebrate should focus on the likely sequel: China will redouble its efforts to buy energy and other resources in shaky developing countries. This will undermine Western efforts to promote transparency and fight corruption there, damaging U.S. interests and values far more than a Unocal takeover. To see why this is so, begin with China's motives. China wants to control supplies of oil and other commodities because it's scared of price shocks; owning oil or other mineral reserves provides anti-shock insurance. As Chinese economists argue, their economy is extremely vulnerable to external shocks because it's extremely open. The Unocal defeat is not going to stanch China's drive to buy foreign resources. China has two ways to do that. It can buy Western resource companies: That was the Unocal strategy. Or it can do deals in resource-rich developing countries, which tend to be plagued with corruption, human rights abuses and other unsavory practices. To cite just two of many examples, China has invested in Sudan and Zimbabwe, propping up both countries' unspeakable dictatorships. As far as Western interests are concerned, these Chinese resource investments may sound like a marginal threat. But they go to the heart of the most promising growth area in development policy. Old development was based on aid and trade, but there's a limit to how much aid poor countries can absorb, and trade isn't a panacea. New development adds a third tool: a focus on governance and transparency in poor countries and also, crucially, among the outside governments and firms that deal with them. Why are outsiders so important? Because the insiders -- the poor countries themselves -- face a sort of Catch-22. You can urge a corrupt government to reform itself, but its own corruption constitutes an obstacle. You can dream up development projects to promote better governance: training for judges, civil service reform, budget transparency laws and so on. But how do you administer a project to improve public administration when administration itself is the problem?","{'shocks', 'control', 'vulnerable', 'development', 'poor', 'human rights'}",0.3338830987871809

NYT_ENG_20060314.0106,"BREAD-HUNGER-0315-COX. Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Elizabeth Coleman relies on moral persuasion to marshal recruits in the fight against hunger. ""Our country is the wealthiest nation in the world, but we spend less than one half of one percent of our budget on poverty-focused development assistance,"" she told church members from around metro Atlanta Saturday. ""We as Christians need to stand up for the poorest people in the world."" Coleman is regional organizer in the Atlanta office of Bread for the World, a Christian nonprofit with 55,000 members from 45 denominations and 2,500 churches who donate money, write letters or teach about hunger. Members write letters urging senators and representatives to support legislation they believe will reduce hunger. On Saturday, Coleman addressed about 25 people from Episcopalian, Methodist and other metro churches meeting at Druid Hills Presbyterian Church. She conducts several such workshops around the Southeast. Coleman urged attendees to pen handwritten letters to elected officials -- and urge members of their churches to do the same -- supporting increased funding for ""poverty-focused development assistance."" That's a catch-all term for foreign aid programs that immunize children, build schools, train teachers, provide life-sustaining medicine for people suffering from AIDS and take other steps to reduce poverty and hunger. Coleman told the crowd that President Bush announced an ambitious plan in 2002 to increase development assistance each year for three years. The increases were to go to the Millennium Challenge Account, a new way to provide aid to developing nations that meet standards for anti-corruption and good government. Yet the actual funding levels have been lower than promised. Bush said in 2002 that the United States would spend $5 billion this budget year on programs funded by the Millennium Challenge Account, but Congress set aside just $1.8 billion. Focus placed on U.S. Coleman said the United States should fully fund the account. Bread for the World typically focuses on one piece of legislation a year -- a measure addressing domestic hunger one year, hunger abroad the next. The 2006 initiative is on increasing poverty-focused development assistance, but Coleman urged the troops Saturday to fight for a priority from last year, the Hunger Free Communities Act. The bill asks the federal government to publish hunger statistics by county. It also would set aside $50 million to help food banks and other groups feed the hungry. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) controls the bill's fate as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Most of the 25 participants Saturday asked Chambliss in letters to move the bill from his committee to let the full Senate vote. A committee spokesman said legislators need more information before making a final decision. Crossing boundaries Last year, grass-roots lobbying by Bread for the World and others groups helped persuade Chambliss and other members of Congress to discard plans to cut nearly $600 million from the food-stamp budget. With $4.6 million in revenue nationally, Bread for the World has a board that includes prominent Republicans, such as former Sen. Bob Dole and Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and well-known Democrats, such as Mike McCurry, press secretary for President Bill Clinton, and Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff. The Atlanta office is staffed by Coleman and Suzanne Berman, a native of Virginia who crisscrosses the Southeast talking to college students and church groups. ""A lot of my job is to make Americans -- who are compassionate and caring people -- look beyond their borders,"" she said. Her presentation Saturday stressed the 2 billion people worldwide living on less than $2 a day and her assertion that a relatively modest increase in assistance could ""make a huge difference."" Armed with a placard saying that one child dies of malaria every 29 seconds and that someone is infected with HIV every 60 seconds, Berman echoed Coleman's call for church members to voice their convictions to members of Congress. ""The budget is a moral document,"" she said. Mark Bixler writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Thai officials acknowledge that the summit's agenda will include problems of democracy and human rights, covering, specifically, wide-ranging subjects such as manpower-developing efforts, poverty, child abuse and poor working conditions. These are all sensitive political issues that European countries have used as ammunition to try to shut Asian products out of their markets by arguing that the availability of child labor and low-wage labor made them cheap. These topics are said to have been proposed by the European side. It seems unusual that such issues were put on the summit's agenda. Why did the Asian side agree to it? Solid economic growth has given many members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other Asian countries self-confidence.

We will continue to put expansion of employment high on the government's agenda for economic and social development. We will follow fiscal, tax and banking policies that promote employment and actively support the efforts of individuals to start their own businesses or find work for themselves. The focus of our employment work will be on finding employment for people who have been laid off and are still unemployed and those who worked at enterprises that are now bankrupt. We need to actively help zero- employment households and people who have difficulty finding employment find jobs, improve guidance and services for university graduates and promote the reform of the way discharged military personnel are assisted in returning to civilian life. We will develop harmonious labor relations, fully implement the labor contract system and protect the lawful rights and interests of workers. We will step up development of the social safety net. This year 's central government budget includes allocations totaling 201.9 billion yuan for strengthening the social safety net, an increase of 24.7 billion yuan over last year. We will continue to improve the basic old-age pension system for enterprise employees and proceed with the expansion of trials to fully fund personal old- age pension accounts. We will improve the system of basic medical insurance and the system of unemployment, workers' compensation, and pregnancy and maternity insurance for urban workers. We will accelerate the establishment of a social safety net targeted at rural migrant workers in cities, with the focus on signing them up for workers' compensation insurance and medical insurance for major diseases. We will step up efforts to formulate methods for transferring social security accounts of workers moving from one region to another. We will further expand coverage for social security, particularly coverage for people employed in the non- public sector such as those working in overseas-funded or private enterprises and urban residents with flexible employment. We will collect and build social security funds through a variety of channels. We will improve the methods for collecting and managing social security premiums to raise the collection rate. We will strengthen oversight and management of social welfare funds such as social security funds and matching fund programs for housing and strictly prevent their misuse. We will energetically develop social welfare programs. We will improve the urban and rural social welfare system. We will improve the urban basic cost of living allowance system, the urban and rural subsidized medical care system, and the assistance system for urban vagrants and beggars. We will set up a nationwide basic minimum cost of living allowance system this year for rural residents, which is another major measure in the work to resolve issues related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers and build a harmonious society.

Bangladesh's government on Monday unveiled huge subsidies and welfare measures in a 14.6 billion dollar budget it hopes will shield the poor from soaring food and other key commodity prices. Finance Minister A.B. Mirza Azizul Islam announced the budget for the 2008-09 fiscal year, beginning July 1, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on television and radio. The military-backed emergency government's second budget since taking power in January last year would see some 30 percent of the 999.62 billion taka (14.6 billion dollars) budget being spent on subsidies and social protection measures, Islam said. ""In the backdrop of the negative impacts of international price hikes of oil, food and fertiliser, together with internal shocks, an expansionary fiscal policy to protect the poor and the low-income group of the community has become essential,"" he said.

(c) 1997, The Washington Post Improving workers' living conditions is not what motivates companies to invest in poor countries. If that happens -- and critics say it sometimes does not -- it is a byproduct of the search for profits. Minoru Harada, a member of the board of directors of Honda Motor Co., put it simply: ``We decide where to invest by looking for areas with economic growth. We are not motivated by the fact that we will drastically change the employment situation of a country.'' For example, computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. owned 200 housing units in Beijing and sold them to its Chinese employees on very favorable terms, enabling them to become first-time homeowners -- but not because of a desire to promote the American ideal of property ownership. Rather, the California-based company wanted to get out of the business of being a landlord, a role it found itself in because of a government requirement that it provide housing for its employees. For all the stories in which workers somehow benefit, of course, there have been many cases in which foreign factories have abused workers. Extensive media coverage in the last several years has reported how Nike workers in Indonesia were fired for seeking better working conditions; how Korean shoe factory managers were found beating employees in Vietnam; and how children worked 14-hour days making soccer balls in Pakistan.","{'workers', 'working conditions', 'property', 'poor', 'ownership'}",0.3084505282181926

XIN_ENG_20030320.0021,"Full text of finance minister's budget report (4). In accordance with relevant provisions of the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Strengthening Examination and Supervision of the Central Budget, the revenue of 37.4 billion yuan in excess of the projected figure in the central budget for 2002 was used to increase funding for highway construction and to replenish the national social security fund in light of the actual needs for social and economic development. This was reported in writing to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress according to regulations. Local authorities used revenue in excess of the projected figures in the local budgets mainly for the purpose of increasing social security expenditures and paying overdue wages and salaries. The pattern of expenditures was adjusted to ensure funding for the development of key social undertakings. In view of the overall interests of reform, development and stability, all local authorities and government departments pooled their financial resources to guarantee funding for key projects while keeping general spending under strict control. First, more funds were allocated to help low-income groups and people in straitened circumstances solve essential problems in their production and lives. While continuing to ensure that the living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and basic pensions for retirees were paid on time and in full and the subsistence allowances were provided to those living below the poverty line, we raised basic pensions for retirees from state-owned enterprises again as of July 1, 2002. We paid special attention to workers, army officers transferred to civilian jobs and former industrialists and merchants who had retired a long time ago and whose basic pensions were low. Benefits were again increased for older ex-servicepersons living in rural areas and for retired veteran cadres who joined the revolutionary ranks in the early days of New China. Subsidies were provided in a timely manner to support the closedown and bankruptcy of 87 state-owned enterprises according to law and to guarantee the working and living needs of the 380,000 affected employees. Expenditures for social security programs from the central budget for 2002 came to 136.2 billion yuan, an increase of 38.6% over that of the previous year. In addition, financial authorities cooperated with competent government departments to tighten collection, management and supervision of social security funds and improve the method of making special transfer payments for social security and the system for managing the special financial accounts for subsidies under social security programs. Experimentation with the reform of social insurance fees collected by tax organs was extended to 16 provinces. In addition, financial authorities took an active part in and gave support to the reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban employees and experimentation with the reform to improve the urban social security system in Liaoning and other provinces. All this promoted smooth implementation of the reforms. Statistics show that basic pensions for retirees from state-owned enterprises and living allowances for workers laid off from state- owned enterprises who had registered with reemployment service centers were basically paid on time and in full as of the end of 2002. The number of urban residents who received subsistence allowances increased from 1.84 million at the end of 1998 to 20.6 million at the end of 2002. This helped maintain social stability. Second, more funds were allocated to agriculture, rural areas and farmers to promote rural development and stability. Experimentation with the reform of taxes and administrative charges in rural areas was extended to 20 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government). The burden on farmers was lightened by an average of 30% in areas where the reform was carried out, with even greater reduction in some areas. This reform was praised by farmers as a ""project of governance by virtue."" In 2002 subsidies totaling 24.5 billion yuan were allocated from the central budget as transfer payments to areas where the reform was carried out. This guaranteed the normal operation of political power at lower levels in those areas, supported the development of compulsory education in rural areas, and played a vital role in stabilizing and reducing the burden on farmers and rationalizing rural economic relationships. A total of 108.8 billion yuan from the central and local budgets for 2002 was used to support rural production and integrated agricultural development and provide operating expenses for departments in charge of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and meteorology, an increase of 18.6% over that of the previous year.

WPB_ENG_20100616.0002,"Workers of the World, Unite. But Carefully.. The workers are rising in the workers' republic. In China's south coastal provinces, which long ago supplanted the American Midwest as the world's premier manufacturing belt, employees have gone on strike at a series of factories. Nobody knows how many plants have been threatened with shutdowns or have ground to a halt; one American attorney who's spent a good deal of time with such workers estimates that it may be close to 1,000. The cause of the unrest is no mystery. China's rise to industrial preeminence (in a quantitative if not qualitative sense) has come on the backs of workers whose wages the government has, until recently, suppressed to keep the price of exports artificially low. The official Communist Party-dominated All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is not really a union. Workers do not choose its leaders, who most frequently come from management. ""The union,"" says the attorney, ""is less state-dominated than employer-dominated."" That is a logical consequence of two party priorities: to build an industrial sector that dominates global markets through low prices; and to prohibit the existence of any organizations that could eventually challenge party control. While the latter priority is an iron rule, the former is merely situational. Now that China's industrial might is established, and many of the world's leading manufacturers are so deeply and profitably invested in China that large-scale relocation is almost unimaginable, the wage suppression that fueled China's rise is beginning to cause the party as many problems as it once solved. Inequality is rampant; a young, better-educated workforce, cognizant of the new Chinese prosperity and frustrated at their inability to share in it, is no longer content simply to reap the marginal benefits of swapping rural for factory life. Having gone online and seen Par-ee _ or, at least, Shanghai _ there's no keeping them down on the farm or in sweatshops. Thus, the strike wave _ and the government's semi-demi-support for the striking workers. In recent weeks, as Honda factories and others have been shuttered, some provincial governments have raised their minimum wage while national officials have vowed to remedy the plight of the tens of millions of migrants who toil in the factories. The government has permitted media coverage of some strikes, which has highlighted the long hours, low pay and poor working conditions that employees endure. For the moment, strikes are OK in China; spontaneous collective bargaining is fine. Independent unions, however, are not. Yet it seems that the Communist Party doesn't have much to fear. To the extent that strike leaders have been quoted, they make clear that the job actions are about wages and working conditions _ not about challenging the party's hegemony. ""If they give us 800 renminbi a month,"" one such striker told the New York Times, ""we'll go back to work right away.""","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'control', 'working conditions', 'poor'}",0.3004725850260771

The Ugandan government announced on Monday that starting April next year it will start paying a monthly stipend to the chronically poor in a five-year 40 million pounds ( about 64 million U.S. dollars) pilot project. George Bekunda, the director of social protection in the Ministry of Gender and Social Development, told reporters here that over 600,000 people in 95,000 households will benefit from the program dubbed Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE). The grants will be paid to two categories of people namely the old age grants payable to elderly citizens above 65 years and the vulnerable grants payable to labor constrained households such as those headed by disabled, orphans and widows. Bekunda said the SAGE project mainly funded by the British development aid agency, Department for International Development (DFID), will target households which can not benefit from the poverty alleviation programs set up by the Ugandan government. If the project is successful it will be rolled out through out the East African country from the initial 14 districts, according to Bekunda.","{'social protection', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.29487176774182744

The Netherlands' development cooperation minister has said he wants to restrict export subsidies for Dutch companies in developing countries and ensure that the money is used to fight poverty in these countries, a Dutch newspaper reported Monday. Speaking at a conference in The Hague on Saturday, Bert Koenders said he wanted to ensure that the subsidies, which amount to 120 million euro a year, were only used for projects that genuinely contribute to fighting poverty and helping the business community in developing countries. Koenders said he and Dutch State Secretary for Economic Affairs Frans Heemskerk were discussing the subject with trade unions, the business sector and other organizations, the Financiele Dagblad newspaper reported. The Netherlands must also make efforts to fight corruption and the public prosecution department should be given more resources to investigate whether Dutch companies are guilty of bribing civil servants in developing countries, Koenders was quoted as saying. Companies that receive export subsidies must sign the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the environment, working conditions, child labor and competition, Heemskerk said.","{'working conditions', 'development cooperation', 'child labor', 'development', 'poverty'}",0.2933970562129708

""There is no future in globalization that tolerates predatory behavior and the hoarding of its profits by a minority. There is no future in globalization that destroys the social and environmental balances, crushes the weak and denies human rights,"" Chirac said. He said social concerns should permeate all international action and should inspire politically committed approaches to improve the consistency and coordination of the multilateral system.

XIN_ENG_20090129.0199,"Full text of Chinese premier's speech at World Economic Forum
Annual Meeting 2009 (part II). We encourage our enterprises to upgrade technologies and make technological renovation. We support them in making extensive use of new technologies, techniques, equipment and materials to restructure their product mix, develop marketable products and improve their competitiveness. Our financial support policies are being improved, a sound credit guarantee system installed and market access eased for the benefit of SME development. Fourth, actively encourage innovation and upgrading in science and technology. We are speeding up the implementation of the National Program for Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development with a special focus on 16 key projects in order to make breakthroughs in core technologies and key generic technologies. This will provide scientific and technological support for China's sustainable economic development at a higher level. We are developing high-tech industrial clusters and creating new social demand and new economic growth areas. Fifth, substantially raise the level of social security. We have accelerated the improvement of social safety net. We will continue to increase basic pension for enterprise retirees and upgrade the standard of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation. We will raise the level of basic cost of living allowances in both urban and rural areas, welfare allowances for those rural residents without family support and the special allowances and assistance to entitled groups. This year, the central budget for social security and employment will increase at a much higher rate than the growth of the overall fiscal revenue. We are advancing the reform of the medical and health system and working to put in place a nationwide basic medical and health system covering both urban and rural areas within three years and achieve the goal of everyone having access to basic medical and health service. It is estimated that governments at all levels will invest RMB 850 billion for this purpose. We give priority to education and are now working on the Guidelines of the National Program for Medium- and Long-Term Educational Reform and Development. This year, we will increase public funds for compulsory education in rural areas, offer more financial support to students from poor families and improve the well-being of middle and primary school teachers so as to promote equity in education and optimize the educational structure. We are using every possible means to lessen the impact of the financial crisis on employment. We are following a more active employment policy. In particular, we have introduced various policy measures to help college graduates and migrant workers find jobs and provided more government-funded jobs in public service. These major policy measures as a whole target both symptoms and root causes, and address both immediate and long-term concerns. They represent a holistic approach and are mutually reinforcing. They are designed to address the need to boost domestic demand, readjust and reinvigorate industries, encourage scientific innovation and strengthen social security. They are designed to stimulate consumption through increased investment, overcome the current difficulties with long-term development in mind, and promote economic growth in the interest of people's livelihood. These measures can mobilize all resources to meet the current crisis. China's economy is in good shape on the whole. We managed to maintain steady and relatively fast economic growth in 2008 despite two unexpected massive natural disasters. Our GDP grew by 9 percent. CPI was basically stable. We had a good grain harvest for the fifth consecutive year, with a total output of 528.5 million tons. Eleven million and one hundred and thirty thousand new jobs were created in cities and towns. Household income in both urban and rural areas continued to rise. The financial system functioned well and the banking system kept its liquidity and credit asset quality at a healthy level. When China, a large developing country, runs its affairs well, it can help restore confidence in global economic growth and curb the spread of the international financial crisis. It will also help increase China's imports and outbound investment, boost world economic growth and create more development and job opportunities for other countries. Steady and fast growth of China's economy is in itself an important contribution to global financial stability and world economic growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, Will China's economy continue to grow fast and steadily? Some people may have doubts about it. Yet I can give you a definite answer: Yes, it will. We are full of confidence. Where does our confidence come from? It comes from the fact that the fundamentals of China's economy remain unchanged. Thanks to our right judgment of the situation and prompt and decisive adjustment to our macroeconomic policy, our economy remains on the track of steady and fast development. Our package plan takes into consideration both the need to address current difficulties and that of long-term development. It is beginning to produce results and will be more effective this year. Our confidence comes from the fact that the long-term trend of China's economic development remains unchanged. We are in an important period of strategic opportunities and in the process of fast industrialization and urbanization. Infrastructure construction, upgrading of industrial and consumption structures, environmental protection and conservation projects, and various social development programs—all can be translated into huge demand and growth potential and will bolster relatively high-speed growth of our economy for a long time to come. Our confidence also comes from the fact that the advantages contributing to China's economic growth remain unchanged. With 30 years' of reform and opening-up, we have laid a good material, technological and institutional foundation. We have a large well- trained and relatively low-cost labor force. We have a healthy fiscal balance, a sound financial system and adequate funds. Our system enables us to mobilize the necessary resources for big undertakings. There is harmony and stability in our society. What is more important, we follow a scientific approach to development which puts people first and seeks comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development. We are committed to reform, opening-up and win-win progress. We have found the right development path in line with China's national conditions and the trend of our times. Our people are hard-working, persevering and resilient. It is precisely these fine qualities that endow China, a country with a time-honored history, with greater vitality in the face of adversities. At the same time, there is no fundamental change in the external environment for China's economic growth. The pursuit of peace, development and cooperation is the irreversible trend in today's world. The readjustment to the international division of labor offers new opportunities. We have the confidence, conditions and ability to maintain steady and fast economic growth and continue to contribute to world economic growth.

In a statement released on Monday, the UN office said an estimated 20-30 percent of workers in garment factories, construction sites and the tourism industry have lost their jobs since late 2008, resulting in the loss of 35-40 million U.S. dollars in remittances. ""The poor, and mainly women in the case of the garment sector, are bearing the brunt of the downturn,"" it added. The most profound impacts of the downturn are being felt by the poor and near poor, particularly those who are in debt. This is especially true in rural areas, home to many of the vulnerable who moved to the cities in search of employment. The downturn presents challenges not only to individuals, but also to Cambodia's progress toward the achievement of the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals, as foreign investment in construction dwindles, garment orders decline and tourist income drops off. The statement said the UN office here has undertaken a study to gain an understanding of the impact of the downturn as well as to identify measures to minimize the damage to human development achievements, restore progress in poverty reduction and prepare for the future.","{'workers', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.2861979235175983

With China's economic development and industrial structure adjustment, the proportion of those employed in primary industry has dropped significantly while that in tertiary industry has risen greatly. In 2009 the proportion of employment in primary, secondary and tertiary industries changed to 38.1 percent, 27.8 percent, and 34.1 percent from 50 percent, 22.5 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively in 2000. Good progress in talent development. People having professional knowledge or special skills who contribute to society through creative work are highly regarded in China. They are a high- ability and high-quality labor force among human resources. The Chinese government has drawn up and implemented a series of major principles and policies to advance the building of contingents of people of all kinds for the Party and government, enterprise operation and management, professional techniques, high technology, rural affairs and social work in an all-round way. Through years of efforts, the number of talented people has maintained a stable increase, with improved quality, optimized structure and gradually rising utilization efficiency. By the end of 2008 the total number of such people in China had reached 114 million. Gradual improvement of income, health care and social security as guarantees for human resources development. With the country's sustained and rapid socioeconomic development, the income of urban and rural residents has maintained a stable growth. The average disposable income of urban residents increased from less than RMB 100 yuan in 1949 to 15,781 yuan in 2008; and the average net income of rural residents increased from RMB 44 yuan in 1949 to 4,761 yuan in 2008. Great efforts have been mobilized to build up the public health system so as to provide guarantee for improving the health of people nationwide. By the end of 2009 there were 289,000 medical institutions nationwide, 5.22 million medical workers and 3.96 million hospital beds in total. In recent years, the Chinese government has vigorously accelerated the building of the social security system to cover rural and urban residents and to provide basic life assurance for each individual. In 2009, urban basic retirement insurance covered 235.5 million people; the total number of urban employees covered by basic medical insurance, urban residents covered by basic medical insurance and people in the countryside covered by the new rural cooperative medical insurance reached 1.2 billion; unemployment insurance, work- related injury insurance and maternity insurance covered 127.15 million, 148.96 million and 108.76 million people, respectively. China implements a subsistence allowance system. By the end of 2009, 23.477 million urban residents and 47.593 million rural residents had enjoyed subsistence allowances from the government. China has implemented planned and organized large-scale poverty relief programs throughout the country. In 2009, the rural population living in poverty was reduced to 35.97 million, with the nationwide poverty rate dropping to 3.6 percent. II. Legal System for Human Resources Development Adhering to the strategy based on the rule of law, China actively promotes democratic and scientific legislation to provide legal security for the fair and equal rights of individual development for everyone, and the scientific development of human resources. Through years of development, China has established a human resources development legal system with the Constitution as the essential basis, the Labor Law and the Civil Servant Law as the foundation, the Labor Contract Law, the Employment Promotion Law, and the Law on Mediation and Arbitration of Labor Disputes as the main contents, and other separate laws and administrative regulations as major components.

LTW_ENG_20050923.0076,"Managing the Next Disaster. Like a bad horror movie in which the villain keeps coming back, Hurricane Rita, the 18th storm of the season, is spinning toward an inevitable rendezvous with the Gulf Coast. We've already seen more death and destruction than the last 35 hurricane seasons combined. And many people, including some European and U.S. politicians, are hoping that the carnage -- represented most poignantly by the destruction in New Orleans -- will help bring this country to its senses on dealing with global warming. But understanding what this hurricane season is really telling us about why we're so vulnerable to climate-related catastrophes means facing up to an unavoidable fact: Efforts to slow global warming will have no discernible effect on hurricanes for the foreseeable future. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adequately preparing for future disasters are essentially separate problems. Reducing emissions is a crucial environmental, economic and geopolitical goal. But if we are concerned about hurricanes, then we need to manage what is within our control on the ground, not what is proving to be beyond our control in the atmosphere. The truth is, the number and scale of disasters worldwide has been rising rapidly in recent decades because of changes in society, not global warming. In the case of hurricanes, the continuing development and urbanization of coastal regions around the world accounts for all of the increases in economic and human losses that we have experienced. Even if tomorrow we could somehow magically put an end to global warming, the frequency and magnitude of climate-related disasters would continue to rise unabated into the indefinite future as more people inhabit vulnerable locations around the world. Our research suggests that for every $1 of future hurricane damage that scientists expect in 2050 related to climate change, we should expect an additional $22 to $60 in damage resulting from putting more people and property in harm's way.","{'disasters', 'control', 'vulnerable', 'property', 'development'}",0.2804121738980095

Vietnam should provide private investors and poor people, especially farmers with wider access to credit, technology and land so as to accelerate poverty reduction, said Lennart Bage, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a specialized agency of the United Nations. Vietnam should better deal with natural disasters and climate change impacts, including floods, typhoons, droughts, mudslides and salinity intrusion; halt land degradation and deforestation; improve local investment environment; develop rural businesses; and expand market access for poor rural people, the UN official, who is on a working visit to Vietnam, told reporters Friday. One of the ways to ensure that poor rural people benefit from Vietnam's fast- growing economy is ""creating right market conditions for private investors in agriculture and their cooperation with farming households,"" he said. Vietnamese poor farmers, small holders and other rural households might not know, or be able to increase their incomes from the commodity value chains through processing or negotiating with the wholesale customers who are in a position to obtain fairer prices for them for their agricultural products.

NYT_ENG_20001026.0019,"LOOKING AT POVERTY, SEEING UNTAPPED RICHES. The outskirts of third-world cities today are vast jumbles of tin, concrete and misery. Practically every large city in Latin America, Asia and Africa is ringed with settlements of migrants from the countryside. These migrants claim their plots in nighttime land invasions, living under blankets and poles while stockpiling materials for better housing. They establish threadbare small businesses selling fruit or cobbling shoes for their equally impoverished neighbors. And all this takes place outside the margin of the law. These precarious concrete houses and makeshift enterprises are the symbols of poverty today for much of the world. But Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, sees them as something else _ assets. To de Soto, the world's poor own trillions of dollars' worth of assets. But these houses, farms and businesses have no formal titles. The lack of legal proof of ownership means that people cannot use their houses as collateral for loans, sell stakes in their businesses, buy insurance to minimize risks or do other things that people in developed nations can do to turn a little money into a lot of money. But if the poor could get formal title to their property, these dead assets would become trillions of dollars in live capital. De Soto, who leads the Institute for Liberty and Democracy in Lima and became known in America as author of the book ``The Other Path,'' has now written ``The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.'' The answer, he says, lies not in political culture, geography or work ethic, but in the unglamorous world of property registries. Capitalism in America and Britain, he argues, took off when governments decided to make it easy for people to get title to their property. The same would be true in the third world, where the vast majority of dwellings and businesses are what is known as informal holdings. De Soto can be excessively enthusiastic about the joys of property rights. Surely the rise of liberal democracy had something to do with the success of capitalism in developed nations. But overall, his idea is a powerful one. He convincingly argues that lack of legal title has crippled economic development. Once their property is considered legal, people no longer have to bribe the police to keep from being turned off their land. They can get cheaper credit in banks instead of going to loan sharks. Only legal proprietors can improve their businesses, confident their investment will not suddenly vanish. Informal businesses are invisible to investors. Few providers of electricity, telephone lines or water are willing to grant services to buildings for which no one is legally responsible.","{'poverty', 'property', 'development', 'poor', 'ownership'}",0.2757333064462575

""At least 2 million children have died in the last decade as a result of wars waged by adults, many targeted as noncombatants or killed in action as soldiers,"" she said. ""Three times that number were disabled or seriously injured, with many more brought down by the indirect consequences of war, such as disease, malnutrition, sexual violence, and the hardships of forced flight."" ""Vulnerability is also a consequence of disempowerment and exclusion from decision-making, not only among the poor but among groups that are geographically or socially isolated, such as ethnic minority groups, the internally displaced, nomadic populations, and people living with HIV/AIDS,"" she said.","{'disasters', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.2690054977510339

About 18 million of them have found jobs with help from local governments. China has included job creation in its economic and social development plans. China is also stepping up the establishment of a social security system while promoting employment. Statistics from the National Statistics Bureau show that by 2002, China had 140 million people involved in endowment insurance and 100 million in unemployment insurance. Medical insurance has spread to most areas with 94 million people involved. Government departments spend more on public issues related to living standards, including rural needy people, social welfare, compulsory education and public health. Statistics show that China spent 9.5 times more money on social security in 2002 than in 1997, with an average yearly increase of 56.9 percent. accounting for 136.2 billion yuan (16.5 billion US dollars) from the central government, up 38.6 percent than 2001. This year, the central government plans to spend 17.7 billion yuan (2.1 billion US dollars) more in social security. China formulated more policies and regulations concerning living standards in recent years.

Taking into consideration the necessity of  maintaining the ""five balances"" [balancing urban and rural  development, development among regions, economic and social  development, development of man and nature, and domestic  development and opening wider to the outside world, tr.], we took  the initiative to adjust the orientation of funds for bond- financed projects, expanding investment in some sectors and  reducing it in others. The focus of our efforts was to ensure  adequate funding for key ongoing projects and projects in  agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, science and education,  culture and health, energy and road building in counties and  townships. We put off other investment projects where possible,  and in particular, suspended funding for projects in certain  overheated industries. These changes allowed us to strengthen the  management of budgets for bond-financed projects by improving the  examination and approval process and allocating funds in strict  accordance with construction progress. A total of 45.692 billion  yuan was left over for use in bond-financed projects in 2005. In  addition, we adjusted some policies related to tax reduction or  exemption in the real estate industry as needed and increased  support for agriculture while controlling the pace of urban  expansion through measures such as adjustment of the structure of  funds from land-use fees to use some of them to develop  agricultural land. These measures played an active role in  ensuring effective macroregulation and balancing economic and  social development. 3) Energetically supporting work related to employment,  reemployment and social security to promote harmonious social  development. We conscientiously carried out the fiscal and tax preferential  policies formulated by the central authorities to promote  employment and reemployment and continued to support  implementation of the program for college student volunteers to  serve in the western region. The central government increased  funding for reemployment subsidies by 2.225 billion yuan, up 54.6  percent year-on-year. Local authorities also made corresponding  allocations for employment subsidies, effectively contributing to  employment and reemployment efforts. We continued to successfully  maintain the ""two guarantees"" [guarantee of a basic living  allowance for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and  guarantee that the pensions of retirees are paid on time and in  full, tr.] and work to ensure that the urban poor receive  subsistence allowances. The central government spent 14.4 billion  yuan on basic living allowances for laid-off workers to ensure  they were paid on time and in full and took concrete measures to  incorporate the allowances into the unemployment insurance system. The central government paid 52.4 billion yuan in transfer payments for old-age insurance, guaranteeing that basic pensions for  workers retiring from state-owned enterprises were paid on time  and in full. In addition, allocations from the central budget were used to support pilot programs to improve urban social security  systems in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The central government earmarked 296 million yuan to subsidize  local governments in steadily implementing a new system for rural  cooperative medical and health care services on a trial basis. In  addition, 300 million yuan was taken from lottery funds for public welfare to develop the rural medical assistance system. A  financial guarantee mechanism was set up with 1.5 billion yuan in  special transfer payments from the central budget plus  corresponding funding from local budgets to improve the living  standards of economically disadvantaged demobilized servicemen  working as cadres in some enterprises. The central government  appropriated 1.701 billion yuan in subsidies to prevent and  control major floods and droughts and respond to major flooding,  plus 4 billion yuan as relief for people in areas stricken by  catastrophic natural disasters. Local governments also allotted  funds for these purposes. All this not only helped to promptly  resolve the difficulties of disaster victims in their work and  lives, but also put in place a contingency funding mechanism for  responding to natural disasters to make relief supplies and  equipment readily available.

Illegal immigrants are especially wary about approaching police for fear of deportation, and Reno said little to alleviate their concerns. Requests for immunity from deportation in return for testifying against an employer will continue to be taken on a ``case-by-case basis'' with due regard for federal immigration law, the attorney general said.

Equating worker exploitation to slavery, Reno cited instances in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida where migrant farmhands were paid little, toiled in cramped conditions and were threatened with violence if they tried to escape. She also referred to a case last year in which 18 people pleaded guilty to forcing about 60 deaf Mexican nationals to peddle key chains on New York City streets. ``We have tracked down modern-day slave owners and others who exploit workers wherever and whenever we can, but I think we need to do more,'' Reno said. ``We are not interested in containing modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate it in America.

From August 2008 to August 2009, more than 90,000 poor households in California suffered power and gas cuts. A 93-year-old man was frozen to death at his home (http://www.msnbc.msn.com). Poverty led to a sharp rise in the number of suicides in the United States. It is reported that there are roughly 32,000 suicides in the U.S. every year, nearly double the cases of murder, which numbered 18,000 (http://www.time.com). The Los Angeles County coroner's office said the poor economy was taking a toll even on the dead as more bodies in the county went unclaimed by families who could not afford funeral expenses. A total of 712 bodies in Los Angles County were cremated with taxpayers' money in 2008, an increase of 36 percent over the previous year (The Los Angeles Times, July 21, 2009).

The Natural Disaster Relief System China frequently suffers the ravages of natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, windstorms and hailstorms, which have adversely affected people's lives. The Chinese government has set up a special social relief system to relieve the sufferings of victims of unexpected natural calamities. Every year, relief funds are allocated from government budgets at central and local levels for this purpose. From 1996 to 2001, such expenditures reached 21. 26 billion yuan-worth nationwide, providing food, clothing and quilts for 390 million disaster victims. This disaster relief system has gone a long way toward guaranteeing the basic livelihood of the people in the disaster-stricken areas. The Social Mutual Help System Mutual help among neighbors is one of the Chinese nation's fine traditions. Issued in 2000, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Public Welfare Donations institutionalizes and encourages regular donations for social welfare. In 2001, civil affairs departments received 1.59 billion yuan of donations from the general public (including goods converted into money). The Chinese government also encourages enterprises, institutions and mass organizations to organize efforts to help the poor shake off poverty and get rich. Governments at the grassroots levels also operate community services for the poor and needy. Since 1994, trade unions at all levels have organized ""heart-warming activities"" every year to offer help to badly-off families. Over the past few years, a total of 10.44 billion yuan for this purpose have been raised and sympathy visits paid to families of 39.75 million poverty-stricken employees, model workers, retirees, and injured, sick or disabled employees.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 27: When a once-in-a-century natural disaster swept away the lives of more than 100,000 poor Asians last December, the developed world opened its hearts and its checkbooks. Yet when it comes to Africa, where hundreds of thousands of poor men, women and children die needlessly each year from preventable diseases, or unnatural disasters like civil wars, much of the developed world seems to have a heart of stone. Not every African state is failing. Most are not. But the continent's most troubled regions -- including Somalia and Sudan in the east, Congo in the center, Zimbabwe in the south and Ivory Coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the west -- challenge not only our common humanity, but global security as well. The lethal combination of corrupt or destructive leaders, porous and unmonitored borders and rootless or hopeless young men has made some of these regions incubators of international terrorism and contagious diseases like AIDS. Others are sanctuaries for swindlers and drug traffickers whose victims can be found throughout the world. In many of these places, poverty and unemployment and the desperation they spawn leave young men vulnerable to the lure of terrorist organizations, which, beyond offering two meals a day, also provide a target to vent their anger at rich societies, which they are led to believe view them with condescension and treat them with contempt. Training camps for Islamic extremists are now thought to be sprouting like anthills on the savanna.

To date, the inland province of Gansu, northwest China, has helped 1.63 million ethnic minority people out of poverty, with poverty rates among local ethnic people dropping from 86.17 percent in 1982 to 7.67 percent in 2000. Ethnic minority groups account for 9.3 percent of the provincial population, and inhabit 38 percent of the province's total land space. Many ethnic minority people live in regions vulnerable to natural disasters such as drought, hailstorms, agricultural diseases and insect pests. Over the past 20 years, Gansu has poured 2.308 billion yuan ( 278 million U.S. dollars) into poverty eradication in areas inhabited by ethnic minority people. This accounts for 17.69 percent of the total amount used in the province for eliminating poverty. The money spent was mainly used to help ethnic minority people construct water conservancy and power facilities, water supply projects for domestic animals and local residents, and construction of farmland. As a result, irrigated farmland in the 12 counties inhabited by ethnic minority people has expanded from the 20,000 hectares in 1982 to about 54,000 hectares by the end of 2000.

A total of 8.59 million more urban residents found jobs, and 4.4 million laid-off workers were reemployed in 2003; both figures exceeded the targets set for the year. The registered unemployment rate was 4.3% in cities and towns at the end of 2003. The urban population had a per capita disposable income of 8,472 yuan, an increase of 9% in real terms, and the rural population had a per capita net income of 2,622 yuan, an increase of 4.3% in real terms. Living allowances for laid-off workers and old-age pensions for retirees were basically paid on time and in full. Social security coverage further increased, as more people became covered by old-age, medical, unemployment or workman's compensation insurance. Some 22.35 million urban residents received subsistence allowances, 1.7 million more than in 2002. The government allocated special funds to help people in disaster- afflicted areas restore production and improve their living conditions. Programs to give people work in place of relief subsidies continued to expand. Better roads and supplies of electricity and potable water in poverty-stricken areas improved working and living conditions there. Steady progress was made in pilot programs to move impoverished people out of areas afflicted by extremely poor ecological conditions. Because of the complicated and volatile international situation, the unexpected SARS outbreak and the numerous natural disasters, these achievements in China's economic and social development were made only with great difficulty. They are attributable to the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary, which maintained control of the overall situation and remained calm and resolute in making decisions. Credit also goes to local authorities and government departments, which consciously followed the important thought of Three Represents, unified the broad masses of cadres and people and worked hard in a down-to-earth manner. These achievements are also due to the National People's Congress strengthening its oversight and guidance and the CPPCC taking an active part in the deliberation and administration of state affairs. While affirming our achievements, we are clearly aware that there are still many difficulties and problems in China's economic and social development that we cannot afford to ignore. Some longstanding, deep-rooted problems have yet to be solved, and there are still structural barriers holding back economic and social development. Moreover, there are new circumstances and problems affecting the operation of the economy. First, farmers have difficulty increasing their incomes and grain production has dropped considerably. The 2003 increase in per capita net income for the rural population was 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2002. The problem of indiscriminate expropriation of arable land is serious. Grain output for 2003 decreased by 26.4 billion kilograms year-on-year. Second, the problem of unemployment remains serious. We still have about 14 million laid-off workers and unemployed people in cities and towns. Approximately 10 million new urban residents are expected to enter the labor force this year. In addition, large numbers of surplus rural laborers still need to shift to non-agricultural industries and urban areas. Third, there is an excessively wide income gap among some members of society, and in both urban and rural areas many low-income people lead a fairly difficult life. Fourth, the economic structure is still irrational, and too much of our economic growth is based on extensive production. The problems of haphazard investment and low-level, redundant expansion are worsening in some industries and localities, resulting in excess energy consumption, serious waste of resources and environmental pollution. Considerable disparity remains between supply and demand in coal, electricity, oil and transport capacity, and the shortages of resources are increasingly affecting development. Fifth, economic and social development remains imbalanced. The public health service system is far from sound. The situation that rural education remains weak as a whole requires fundamental changes. Sixth, the order of the market economy remains somewhat chaotic. We urgently need to improve the social credit system. Major industrial accidents occur frequently. We need to take a long-term perspective rooted in the present and solve these problems through reform and development.

It warned that the recent East Asia crisis, which battered emerging markets from Russia to Brazil, not only underscores the urgency of protecting poor and vulnerable populations during times of economic upheaval and change, it also shows that safety nets need to be in place before crises strike to have the best chance of success. ""Globalization presents enormous opportunities for developing countries to prosper, but also exposes these countries to greater risk, unless they adopt the economic, social, and institutional reforms necessary to exploit the potential of the global economy; technological change accelerates the pace of development, but at the same time it tends to widen the gulf between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots', both within and among countries,"" the report said.","{'social protection', 'disasters', 'vulnerable', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.24592282483906938

Rural development in Asia has become increasingly linked to a rapidly integrating world economy and is facing new opportunities and challenges in the new millenium, according to a report presented by the Asian development Bank (ADB). While presenting the report on Workshop on the Transformation of Rural Asia held here Wednesday, Shahid Zahid, senior sector specialist of ADB, said that the transformation of rural Asia has also been accompanied by some troubling developments and new challenges. While poor people in rural Asia are declining, more than 670 million rural people (one third of the rural population) are still living in abject poverty, Zahid told a gathering of more than 80 experts, scholars and governmental officials mainly from South Asian countries. Therefore, in the process of rural transformation yet to be completed, a key challenge for policymakers of the region is to continue to promote rapid growth in rural areas while making the growth more pro-poor and more environmentally sustainable, said Dr. Zahid. Resident Representative of UN Food and Agriculture Organization Winston Rudder said that the South Asian countries should strengthen cooperation in countering the frequent disasters in the region in order to achieve a faster development.","{'disasters', 'pro-poor', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.24582616329207352

by Ade Obisesan. African leaders, farmers and heads  of international development agencies will meet here from Friday  hoping to bring a new lease of life to the continent's degraded soil  and so tackle food shortages affecting over 200 million Africans. The African Fertiliser Summit, an initiative of the African  Union (AU), is sponsored by more than a dozen international  organisations and donor agencies, including the International Fund  for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Bank, the FAO (UN Food  and Agriculture Organisation) and the Rockefeller Foundation,  organisers said. African heads of state have developed a Comprehensive African  Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) as a framework for  agricultural growth, food security and rural development. The CAADP has set a goal of six percent annual growth in  agricultural production to reach the United Nation's Millennium  Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger afflicting more that  200 million Africans by 2015, the organisers said in a statement. The summit is being organised to increase awareness on the role  that fertiliser could play in stimulating sustainable pro-poor  productivity growth in African agriculture and to discuss increased  and efficient use of fertiliser by African small farmers.","{'pro-poor', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor'}",0.24457717277037416

Sound progress was made in culture, health, sports, radio, film, TV, the press and publishing. Efforts were constantly intensified to promote spiritual civilization. Progress was smooth in the development of a number of key cultural facilities, rural health facilities, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and specialized hospitals. National fitness activities flourished, and Chinese athletes did well in major sports competitions both at home and abroad. Notable results were achieved in developing urban infrastructure having a direct bearing on people's lives. The poverty-stricken rural population decreased again. The per capita disposable income of urban residents increased by 13.4% in real terms, and the per capita net income of rural residents rose by 4.8%. We continued to strengthen the program to guarantee that the living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and the basic pensions for retirees are paid on time and in full. The program to grant subsistence allowances to the urban poor was notably strengthened. Experiments to improve the urban social security system made great headway. The registered urban unemployment rate was 4% at the end of 2002. Progress was made in environmental protection and in the rational development and use of resources, increasing our ability for sustainable development. Greater efforts were made to improve the environment in key areas by closing a number of seriously polluting enterprises or suspending their operations. Conclusive results were achieved in the prevention and control of water pollution in the valleys of the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers and Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes. Some cities and industrial and mining areas reduced their discharge of sulfur dioxide to bring the worsening acid rain under control. More environmental protection facilities such as sewage and garbage treatment plants were built in urban areas, and 40.3% of urban sewage was brought under centralized treatment. The pace of improving the ecological environment and protecting resources was accelerated. Construction on the south-to-north water diversion project started. The natural population growth rate was 6.45.  (More)","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'social security', 'development', 'poor'}",0.24415508177358547

XIN_ENG_20040316.0395,"Report on China's central and local budgets (full text-6). 2. Investment will be increased for employment work and social security. Employment and social security affect the vital interests of the people, the stability of society and the country's overall development. More support will be given to employment work and social security in the 2004 central budget. First, employment and reemployment work will be strongly supported. While conscientiously carrying out the preferential fiscal and tax policies formulated by the central authorities to promote employment and reemployment, we plan to increase reemployment assistance funds by 3.6 billion yuan, 76.6% more than last year. Second, we will energetically support efforts to guarantee that living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and basic old-age pensions for retirees from these enterprises are paid on time and in full and ensure that low- income urban residents receive their subsistence allowances. To achieve these goals, we plan to allocate 77.9 billion yuan from the 2004 central budget. In addition, we will continue to improve the social security system and raise funds for social security through diversified channels. We will better coordinate the implementation of the reemployment policy and social security programs, including the ""three-stage guarantee"" for laid-off workers. On the basis of a review of the pilot program to improve urban social security systems in Liaoning Province, we will improve its contents and methods and extend it to Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. Third, in order to promote economic restructuring, a number of enterprises will be closed down or declared bankrupt in accordance with the law. We will work harder to free enterprises from the obligation to operate social programs and allocate 17 billion yuan in subsidies for enterprises that close or go bankrupt. We will also provide active support and assistance to people having special difficulties. 3. Investment will be increased for education, health, science and technology, culture and sports. We will improve compulsory education, especially in rural areas. We will accelerate the program to basically make nine-year compulsory education available throughout the western region and basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people there. We will improve the system under which most responsibility for managing rural compulsory education goes to county governments, increase transfer payments to support compulsory education in poor counties, continue to carry out the second phase of the program to renovate dangerous primary and secondary school buildings in rural areas and the program to promote modern distance education, and distribute free textbooks in more areas. We will speed up the development of systems for disease prevention and control and for medical treatment in public health emergencies, raise the level of public health services and our ability to cope with public health emergencies, and improve medical and sanitation conditions in the countryside. We will support efforts to successfully carry out trials to develop a new type of system for rural cooperative medical care and health services. We will support the development of a state system for scientific and technological innovation and the formulation of the state medium- and long-range plan for developing science and technology. We will facilitate reform of the management system of science and technology, and promote innovation in mechanisms and the implementation of key science and technology projects and the application of scientific results in production. We will vigorously develop undertakings in advanced culture and develop culture-related industries. We plan to allocate 95.5 billion yuan from the 2004 central budget for education, health, science and technology, culture and sports, a year-on-year increase of 10 billion yuan, giving priority mainly to rural areas. 4. Transfer payments to local governments will be increased. The central government will again increase transfer payments to local governments in 2004, especially to governments in the central and western regions. In addition to 427.7 billion yuan in tax rebates and structural subsidies, the central government plans to grant local governments 513.3 billion yuan in transfer payments, an increase of 64.4 billion yuan over last year in comparable terms. Of this amount, 223.8 billion yuan will come in the form of general transfer payments, a rise of 32.6 billion yuan compared to last year. In addition, a special task force will be organized to thoroughly investigate and study the causes of financial difficulties at the lower levels of government, and propose specific measures to eliminate them as soon as possible on a type- by-type and step-by-step basis.

NYT_ENG_20020103.0018,"EDITORIAL: HEALTH AID FOR POOR COUNTRIES. The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 3: On the list of factors keeping poor countries poor _ bad governance, war, natural disasters _ a prominent place must go to disease. By the most conservative estimates, malaria robs sub-Saharan Africa of 6 percent of its economic strength, and the actual figure could be even higher than 50 percent. As AIDS spreads, the situation will be even more devastating. Disease cuts the lifespan of workers and reduces productivity. High infant mortality compels families to have many children; the families are thus able to spend less on the health and education of each child, and mothers are kept from joining the work force. Disease discourages tourism and investment. The health of the world's poorest nations is normally and properly measured in lives. Now, a new study commissioned by the World Health Organization puts a dollar figure on the rewards of improving health among the globe's poor. It makes a compelling argument that a dramatic increase in health spending by both rich and poor nations would produce huge economic and human benefits. The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, led by professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, asks rich countries to spend an extra one-tenth of 1 percent of their economies on the health of the poor. In Washington's case, this would mean doubling current health aid, an extra $10 billion a year. If all wealthy countries cooperated, it would add $38 billion a year to health spending by 2015. The commission argues that if that money went to poor nations that also spent more and improved their health care systems, these countries would see at least $360 billion a year in economic gains, lifting millions of people out of poverty. And not incidentally, eight million lives a year would be saved. The study has been well received in Europe, where several prominent leaders have called for a sharp increase in health spending. In Washington, the response has been skeptical. Sachs and his co-authors, including Harold Varmus, formerly the head of the National Institutes of Health, say that one of the biggest obstacles to reaching the study's goals is changing the U.S. view of foreign aid. Here, help for the Third World is dismissed as waste, and Washington finds foreign aid money in the scraps left over after tax cuts and multibillion-dollar increases elsewhere.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'poverty', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.24033439560223677

NYT_ENG_20050831.0172,"BOLTON OFF TO A RECKLESS START. John Bolton was such a controversial nominee for the post of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations that President Bush had to do an end-run around the Senate and make a recess appointment to get him into the job earlier this month. Now in office, Bolton has issued a reckless blast that has put even his critics back on their heels. Five years ago, the United States signed on to the Millennium Development Goals, a U.N. effort to cut abject poverty by half, curb pandemics worldwide and achieve universal basic education for children. Next month, heads of state from nearly 180 nations will hold a summit to promote the goals, which include stopping the spread of TB and malaria, providing access to AIDS treatment and ending ecological destruction. Embarrassingly, Bolton is trying to undermine the upwelling of international support for the Millennium Goals. In recent days, he sent several memos proposing changes that would effectively gut the goals. He not only wants the United States to wriggle out of any commitments, he also wants to stop other nations from fulfilling theirs. His memos contradict what the United States agreed to when it signed the Millennium Goals as well as a 2002 document from the Monterey Conference: Industrialized countries should try to fund development aid proportionately to their gross national product. Now, Bolton says, ""The U.S. does not accept global aid targets."" Most of the industrialized world wants to relieve developing nations of their enormous debt burdens, but Bolton extols the virtues of having impoverished countries take on debt.

Operating behind a veil of secrecy, foreign companies that turn out goods in southern China for some of the United States' leading retailers are driving down China's already poor wages and working conditions, employing mostly poor, young peasant women in sweatshops that resemble labor camps, according to a report released Wednesday. The National Labor Committee, a private New York-based whistle-blowing group, said it sponsored an investigation into 21 garment factories in China that found workers being paid pennies an hour, being forced to work excessive amounts of overtime, being confined to crowded dormitories, being fed a thin rice gruel and being denied any benefits. In a Capitol Hill news conference, Charles Kernaghan, the committee's director, called on a nearly year-old White House task force on sweatshops to take a greater role in promoting labor and human rights in Chinese factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Several members of Congress and civil rights advocates also criticized U.S. companies that buy the goods, saying they have turned a blind eye to the exploitation of Chinese workers in the name of corporate profits. Among the worst conditions found by a team of human rights researchers were those in three privately owned factories making handbags under the label of Kathie Lee Gifford for the giant Wal-Mart chain, the committee's 85-page report said. Two years ago, Kernaghan exposed child labor and sweatshop conditions in factories in Honduras that were making clothes bearing Gifford's label.

They have cut the share of poor people by 11 percentage points in the East African nation of Uganda and by five in West Africa's Ghana, said Dilip Ratha, a senior economist at the World Bank and its expert on migration and remittances.

Bangladesh, the land hit so hard by famine in the past, is now suffering from devastating floods, with more than 600 dead, millions marooned or homeless, and water-borne diseases on the rise. The World Food Program of the United Nations estimates $400 million in crop and livestock losses in a country where 60 percent of the work force depends on on agriculture to survive. Although the flood waters have receded, another blow of monsoon rains is expected in mid-August. And the work of alleviating human misery continues long after the dramatic pictures have faded from the public eye. In many ways, the situation in Bangladesh is typical of natural disasters in the developing world. Often overpopulated, with a poor physical infrastructure and inadequate health care, these countries suffer disproportionately from earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and floods. Buildings crumble easily, power and freshwater systems collapse, and diseases rage through densely populated slums, easily overwhelming local resources. Luckily, the World Food Program is in a good position to help because it already has a presence in the country. Through its development programs and UNICEF, its children's education fund, the agency was able last week to plug into an existing distribution network to dispense high-energy bars and rice to 1.8 million people. Having this kind of infrastructure at the ready when disaster strikes is a little-recognized part of why ongoing support for the UN is so crucial. Donor nations such as the United States need to look beyond the geopolitical squabbles that consume so much energy to the quiet healing work the organization does every day. The UN Development Program in particular is about the business of helping countries build the capacity to withstand future disasters. In 2001 in Gujarat, India, for example, a devastating earthquake killed 20,000 people and left communities in ruins.

You need really big bucks to guarantee that you'll get a hearing in Washington, and Cicih (pronounced CHEE-chee) had no money at all. I suspect that the Riadys, who purchased their own little corner of the administration, would have had a good chuckle over Cicih's ignorance.

Cicih came to the United States last summer to spread the word about the plight of overworked and underpaid Indonesian sweatshop workers. She was one of 24 employees who had been fired from their jobs at a factory making Nike athletic shoes because they had demanded they be paid the legally required minimum wage. Her trip to the United States was arranged by a labor activist named Jeffrey Ballinger and a San Francisco-based human rights group called Global Exchange. The trip was timed to coincide with an anti-sweatshop extravaganza put on by the Clinton administration at Marymount College in Arlington, Va.

They would spend the day brainstorming the problems of inadequate pay, wretched working conditions and child labor in the apparel industry. Cicih felt she had something to contribute. She has been fighting for better pay and improved conditions for Indonesian sweatshop workers since she was fired, in 1992, when the legal minimum wage in West Java was $1.25 a day. She could tell the forum firsthand what it was like to work all day for a pittance in the oppressive and unforgiving world of the sweatshop.","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'working conditions', 'child labor', 'human rights'}",0.2315661054442626

Jeffrey Sachs, director of the UN Millenium Project that aims to  halve world poverty by 2015, said donor responses to urgent appeals  for aid were important but do little to reduce a country or region's  dependence on such help. ""We have to find ways quickly and urgently to take action now to  save the lives of people that are in imminent risk and also make  longer term investnments,"" Sachs said here as he kicked off a  six-nation tour of Africa to review progress made on achieving the  so-called Millenium Development Goals (MGDs). ""Without the support for real investments ... we are not going  to save people,"" he told reporters. ""The climate vulnerability is  extreme and the population pressures are great and the vulnerability  is profound."" Last week, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) issued a  ""special alert"" for the Horn of Africa, appealing for assistance for  some 11 million people in Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia who  it said are at the brink of starvation.","{'famine', 'disasters', 'development', 'poverty', 'natural disaster'}",0.22425229310178665

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday that Haiti has the best chance in decades to escape poverty and political upheaval and he will seek in his new job as U.N. special envoy to improve life for the estimated 9 million Haitians. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and was in the throes of a food crisis and political deadlock when four tropical storms battered it last fall, killing some 800 people and doing $1 billion in damage. Hunger worsened, poverty deepened and hard-won stability threatened to come apart five years after a bloody rebellion. Clinton said he will try to do in Haiti what the U.N. attempted to do when he was the top U.N. envoy promoting recovery from the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami -- ""to leave things better than they were before the natural disasters."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who appointed Clinton to the US$1-a-year post on May 19, told a news conference that ""no one is better placed"" than the former U.S. president to help Haiti's president and prime minister promote their new economic development program and to help ensure that governments deliver on the US$335 million they pledged in April for Haiti's recovery.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed Monday that the United Nations take the lead in bringing advanced information technologies to poor nations, which he said could enable them to leapfrog over traditional stages of development at a surprisingly low cost. In a report designed to set the agenda for a millennium assembly in early September to which all the world's leaders are invited, Annan announced plans to create a new international voluntary corps, the U.N. Information Technology Service, to train groups in developing countries to use the Internet. He also proposed an Internet health network for 10,000 locations in poor nations to give hospitals and clinics access to the latest medical information. And, in a major initiative to be led by the Ericsson telecommunications company of Sweden, the world's largest producer of mobile phones, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross will establish a quick-response service. The program will provide mobile and satellite phones along with microwave links to relief workers facing natural disasters or other emergencies. The recommendations were part of a broad report also covering such predictable subjects as a deteriorating environment, persistent poverty and the spread of weapons worldwide. But in making the information proposals, Annan took another step out of the traditional limits of U.N. action _ through member governments and with their approval. He gave his backing to a leading role for private enterprise, to the discomfort of a number of member nations that strongly oppose growing links with both global business and nongovernmental organizations, which often oppose government policies.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.2214579543753848

The post-apocalyptic montage of floating corpses, scavengers fighting for food and desperate throngs seeking a way out of New Orleans is tragic enough. But for many African-American leaders, there is a growing outrage that many of those still stuck at the center of this tragedy were those who for generations had been pushed to the margins of society. The victims, they note, were largely black and poor, those who toiled in the background of the tourist havens, living in tumble-down neighborhoods that were long known to be vulnerable to disaster if the levees failed. Without so much as a car or bus fare to escape before Hurricane Katrina hit, they found themselves once again left behind by a failure to plan for their rescue should the dreaded day ever arrive. ""If you know that terror is approaching in terms of hurricanes, and you've already seen the damage they've done in Florida and elsewhere, what in God's name were you thinking?"" said the Rev.

Caring for people's well-being, creating more jobs and administering social security work well We consider it highly important to protect the vital interests of the people and help them, especially the needy, in solving problems in their work and daily lives. Governments at all levels conscientiously implemented a series of measures drawn up by the Party Central Committee and the State Council for increasing employment and reemployment and increased their efforts, capital spending and policy support in this regard. The central government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan of subsidies for job creation. We increased our employment guidance and services for last year's college graduates, who were the first to be enrolled under the college expansion plan of 1999. By the end of last year, 83% of last year's graduates from regular institutions of higher learning had found jobs, 600,000 more than the previous year. To continue ensuring the ""two guarantees"" (guaranteeing that the living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and that the pensions of retirees are paid on time and in full) and the ""three-stage guarantee"" for laid-off workers, the central government spent 70 billion yuan in 2003, 19.9% more than the previous year; of this sum, subsidies for subsistence allowances for the urban poor increased from 4.6 billion yuan in 2002 to 9.2 billion yuan in 2003. This allowed 22.35 million urban residents throughout the country to receive such benefits. In 2003, the central government began making annual allocations of special funds to help local governments assist ex-servicemen who are working in enterprises to solve their financial difficulties. Benefits were again raised for disabled revolutionary servicemen and other people who are entitled to special care by the government. We further intensified efforts to alleviate rural poverty through development and we invested more to improve working and living conditions in underdeveloped areas. We made all-out efforts to fight disasters and ensure adequate disaster relief. Central budget funds totaling 8.03 billion yuan were spent on relief for people affected by floods, droughts, earthquakes or other disasters, up 63.9% over the previous year, and 2.79 billion yuan was invested in post-disaster reconstruction. As a result, proper living arrangements were made for people in disaster-afflicted areas, production resumed and reconstruction proceeded in an orderly way. Governments at all levels took the problem of wage arrears for migrant rural workers very seriously, worked harder to resolve it and achieved initial results. 5. Pressing forward with institutional innovation and making significant progress in reform and opening up Institutional restructuring of the State Council was accomplished smoothly on the basis of the plan approved at the First Session of the Tenth National People's Congress and the adjusted and newly set up bodies are now operating normally. Significant progress was made in establishing a macro-control mechanism, restructuring the management of state assets and establishing a mechanism for oversight and management of the banking sector. We unified the mechanisms for administering domestic and foreign trade and improved monitoring systems for food and workplace safety. Institutional restructuring of provincial governments has been basically completed. The reform of the administrative examination and approval system was deepened.

The Chinese Government has paid great attention to exploiting its advantage in labor resources, and actively developed labor-intensive industries and enterprises that have relative advantages and whose products enjoy market demands, particularly private and self-employed businesses and medium and small enterprises with big employment capacity. These industries, businesses and enterprises have accounted for about 80 percent of the new employment in urban areas. In August 2002, China promulgated the ""Medium and Small Enterprises Promotion Law,"" which has further standardized and pushed forward the development of medium and small enterprises.","{'workers', 'control', 'social security', 'development', 'ownership'}",0.21826084496403209

One of the lessons of the tsunami a year ago is that however stingy we Americans have been in giving foreign aid, we want to do better. For every $100 of national income, the United States gives 17 cents in overseas development assistance -- a lower percentage than any donor country except Italy. But after the tsunami, Americans responded with a wave of stunning generosity, and there is growing bipartisan support for helping poor countries. It's an opportunity that President Bush should seize, by working with Tony Blair and Kofi Annan to wage a Global War on Poverty. Bush could help revive his floundering presidency by providing moral leadership to the world. He has taken half-steps in this direction, with his landmark programs against AIDS in Africa and against sex trafficking, but his overall efforts against global poverty have been grudging. It's sad when we must rely for moral vision on poverty on a compassionate rock star, Bono, or a generous computer geek, Bill Gates, instead of our president. If the tsunami demonstrated how generous Americans could be, it also showed the blindness of a system that responds to natural disasters but neglects ongoing suffering. For example, here in the northwestern Sri Lankan town of Puttalam, people might be better off if the tsunami had reached this far and sucked a few victims out to sea.","{'disasters', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.21694637290138097

The meeting, to be held in the Foreign Ministry in Santo Domingo, comes two days after Dominican President Leonel Fernandez and President Rene Preval of Haiti met for the first time during a commerce summit in Miami. Fernandez, who took office in August, campaigned promising to improve relations with French-speaking Haiti. The two countries must agree on a development strategy to be eligible for dlrs 150 in foreign aid. The European Union pledged the funds to relieve poverty along the countries' 275-kilometer (170-mile) border. Also at issue is the poor treatment of Haitian migrant workers, thousands of whom work illegally in the Dominican sugar cane fields. The Haitian government and human rights groups charge the cane workers are routinely mistreated and forced to live in inhumane conditions.","{'inhuman', 'workers', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'human rights'}",0.2165346940090471

LTW_ENG_20070414.0016,"The World Bank, Stuck in the Mud. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, there was a new recognition that poor countries could harm rich ones: Weak and failing states could incubate disease, crime, environmental degradation -- and terrorism. But that healthy recognition is fading, and the World Bank, which ought to be a powerful voice against complacent backsliders, is muted by scandal. Before we get to the World Bank, consider the bigger picture. After Sept. 11, the world launched the Doha round of trade talks, which was supposed to help developing countries; now Doha has fizzled. After Sept. 11, there was hope for more humanitarian intervention; now the Iraq syndrome undermines the Western will to intervene, even in the extreme case of Darfur. The most lasting impact of Sept. 11 on the West's attitude toward development is perhaps a negative one. Opponents of immigration have been handed a convenient argument, with the result that workers from poor countries may have fewer legal opportunities to earn paychecks in rich countries and send money home. Then there is the aid story. After Sept. 11, foreign assistance from governments doubled from $52 billion in 2001 to $107 billion in 2005; and that year, the leaders of the industrialized nations gathered at the Group of Eight summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, and pledged a further doubling of aid to sub-Saharan Africa. But the Gleneagles promise is proving empty. The latest data show that governments gave less in 2006 than they had a year earlier. An analysis by the Center for Global Development projects that aid to sub-Saharan Africa will grow at less than half the rate promised at Gleneagles. The West's financial retreat is a policy retreat, too, because an alternative patron of poor nations is emerging in the form of China. So long as Western governments dominated the aid business, African governments had reason to listen to their advice on fighting corruption and building institutions. But as Western aid budgets tighten, more African leaders will turn to China for cash and technical assistance. China cares little for controlling corruption and still less for democratic notions of accountability. Even though China has developed marvelously itself, its new sway in Africa is likely to set back the struggle against poverty. In times like these, the West needs a clear voice to make the case for development. In the past, this has frequently come from the World Bank: As the bank's president in the 1970s, Robert McNamara coined the phrase ``absolute poverty.'' And James Wolfensohn, his most illustrious successor, did more than anybody else to forge the post-Sept. 11 consensus in favor of development. But there is no moral clarity emanating from the bank right now. Instead, there is demoralizing scandal.","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.21601457866681215

plan(8). 7. We made notable progress in improving people's wellbeing and promoting harmony. We further strengthened work concerning employment and social security. The central government allocated 42.6 billion yuan to promote employment, an increase of 59%. An additional 11.02 million urban jobs were created, 2.02 million more than planned. The urban registered unemployment rate stood at 4.3%, thus meeting the target of keeping it under 4.6%. Employment rate for college and university graduates this year was 87.4%. The number of rural migrant workers totaled 145 million, an increase of 4.92 million. Central government spending on social security was 290.575 billion yuan, an increase of 16.6%. Overall planning for basic old-age insurance for workers of urban enterprises at the provincial level was basically accomplished. The methods for transferring old-age pension accounts for workers who move from one region to another were promulgated and implemented. The number of urban residents covered by basic old- age insurance reached 235 million, 7 million more than planned. The pilot program for a new old-age insurance system for rural residents was launched. The basic medical insurance system for non-working urban residents was fully implemented. The problem of medical insurance for retirees from closed or bankrupt SOEs was properly resolved. The number of participants in the basic medical insurance for urban workers and non-working urban residents increased by 82.39 million to exceed 400 million; and the number of rural residents who signed up for the new type of rural cooperative medical care system increased by 16.3 million to reach 833 million. Standards for enterprise retirees' pensions, urban and rural subsistence allowances and subsidies to entitled groups continued to increase. Channels were further expanded for the funding of social security. People's living standards continued to improve.

This earnest, unsentimental documentary describes the lot of the 246 million children for whom, as the narrator Meryl Streep says in the prologue, ""life is nothing but work."" It was produced, directed and written by Len Morris, a maker of television documentaries on subjects ranging from schizophrenia to apartheid to singing cowboys in Hollywood. Morris travels to eight locations -- from a coffee plantation in Kenya to a stone quarry in Orissa, India -- to interview children, their parents and local activists about the phenomenon of under-age labor, which continues to flourish despite laws banning it in every country. The reasons for this are chillingly articulated by the owner of a carpet factory in India that employs children at its looms: ""Children are more obedient and work harder."" They are also less likely to organize in protest of unfair working conditions. In many places this film visits, like the jirmals, isolated fishing platforms off the coast of Indonesia, children are literally held prisoner, lured by false promises of well-paid work into a lifelong indentured servitude. The bleakness of ""Stolen Childhoods"" is not completely unremitting; the film also celebrates the efforts of a few successful programs to combat the scourge of child labor around the world. Some of these are microeconomic solutions, like the Bolsa Escola, a Brazilian government initiative that pays families for every month of their child's perfect attendance at school, thus reimbursing them the cost of the lost labor. On a more global scale, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, observes in an interview that eliminating child labor is in the interests of international security, since the poverty and alienation of exploited children provides a ""breeding ground for future terrorists."" Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan and environmental and human rights activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, makes the case for the implementation of fair-trade practices, noting that by the time it hits the grocery shelves in the United States, Kenyan-grown coffee has undergone a 4,000 percent markup. And Kailash Satyarthi, a children's advocate in India who has spent his life rescuing children from sweatshops, speaks passionately of children's resilience and capacity to learn, qualities that are evident in the clips of his young charges singing and dancing as he plays a drum.","{'resilience', 'working conditions', 'child labor', 'poverty', 'human rights'}",0.20885575584656807

We sped up the implementation of projects to  prevent and control water pollution in such key areas as the  valleys of the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers and Taihu, Chaohu  and Dianchi lakes and the Bohai Sea, thereby improving water  quality in some of those areas. Greater efforts were made to  prevent geological disasters in the Three Gorges Reservoir area  and to control pollution caused by urban household wastewater,  industrial wastewater, hazardous wastes, and sulfur dioxide  emissions from thermal power plants in the areas affecting the  reservoir. Efforts were accelerated to control pollution along the east route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.

Further progress was made in employment and social security  work, and people's lives continued to improve. A total of 5.1  million laid-off urban workers found new jobs. We raised  subsistence allowances for urban residents in some areas and basic old-age pensions for workers retiring from enterprises. The  numbers of urban residents who were covered by basic old-age,  basic medical, unemployment and worker's compensation insurance  were 163 million, 124 million, 106 million and 68.23 million,  respectively. Urban per capita disposable income was 9,422 yuan,  an increase of 7.7 percent in real terms. Rural per capita net  income was 2,936 yuan, up 6.8 percent in real terms. The numbers  of poverty-stricken and low-income rural residents were reduced by 2.9 million and 6.4 million respectively at the end of 2004  compared to the numbers at the end of 2003. While fully affirming our achievements, we realize that we have only partially achieved our goals in strengthening and improving  macroregulation and that although outstanding conflicts and  problems in our economic activities have been alleviated, they  have yet to be fundamentally resolved and there are still numerous obstacles to maintaining steady and rapid economic development.  First, the agricultural infrastructure remains weak, which  severely restricts our ability to increase the acreage sown to  grain and the yield per unit area, and climatic conditions are  unpredictable. All this makes it very difficult to continue to  increase grain production and rural income. Second, there are too  many fixed asset investment projects under construction, and too  many new ones are being started. The driving force behind  investment growth is strong, and investment demand could return to excessive levels. Third, there are tight constraints on resources  and the environment, and coal, electricity, petroleum and  transportation are still in short supply. There is significant  inflationary pressure. Environmental pollution remains serious in  some areas. Fourth, rural education, health, culture and other  social undertakings fall far short of what is needed for  development and improved living standards in rural areas. Fifth,  the employment situation is gloomy. The income gap between some  members of society is too wide, and some low-income people lead  difficult lives.

LTW_ENG_20050901.0150,"Lagging Disaster Relief Weighs Heavily on Poor. When disaster strikes in the United States, Americans expect a full-throttle response from the government, with everything it takes to help to the victims -- from food, water and rescue teams to emergency medical supplies, helicopters, National Guard soldiers to protect property and life. And the response is expected to be fast and efficient. But that's not how it worked out this time. Four days after Hurricane Katrina struck, untold numbers of storm victims remained trapped on roof tops and highway overpasses. Thousands lacked adequate food, water and medical attention. And civil authority had broken down so completely that rescue workers trying to reach devastated sections of the city were sometimes driven off by gunfire. What went wrong? Why was an area long identified as a disaster waiting to happen apparently so ill prepared? And how could the federal agencies that are charged with preparing for such emergencies -- and have often reacted effectively in the past -- have appeared to stumble so badly? The questions seemed all the more pointed as it became clear that most of the suffering was occurring not the storied precincts of Bourbon Street, the Latin Quarter or the Garden District, but in parts of the city tourists seldom see -- the predominantly black, working-poor neighborhoods of ``the other New Orleans.'' It's not as though no one had seen the disaster coming. For years, studies by federal and other authorities had pinpointed New Orleans as one of the most vulnerable areas in the country for a natural disaster, a major city lying below sea level, sandwiched between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi river, and located in the heart of hurricane country. As recently as last November, one expert laid out a disaster scenario that read like a script for Katrina.","{'workers', 'vulnerable', 'property', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.20852763238395097

We will promote the adjustment of the distribution of national income; increase government subsidies; raise the people's consumption capacity, particularly that of low- and middle-income earners; improve fiscal and taxation policies for guiding consumption; and get consumption to play a bigger role in driving economic growth. We will further increase subsidies to farmers and raise minimum prices for the purchase of key grain varieties to increase their incomes. We will raise subsistence allowances for urban and rural residents, basic old- age pensions for enterprise retirees, and subsidies and living allowances for entitled groups. We will vigorously expand employment, and support implementation of the minimum wage system to increase the income of low-income earners. We will apply a performance-based salary system in schools providing compulsory education, public health institutions, and community-based medical and health service institutions. We will improve policies for promoting purchases of home appliances and motor vehicles including motorbikes by rural residents, and for subsidizing trade-ins of old home appliances and motor vehicles for new ones, and we will guide consumer spending. Second, we will arrange and use public investment well and vigorously optimize its structure. We will focus on supporting low-income housing, rural infrastructure, social programs such as education and medical and heath care, energy conservation, environmental protection, ecological conservation, independent innovation and restructuring, as well as underdeveloped areas. Investment funds will be used mainly for carrying on and completing projects and making sure we don't leave projects half finished. We will strictly control the launching of new projects and prevent redundant construction. We will support recovery and reconstruction in earthquake-hit areas. We will expand the scope of substituting awards for subsidies in projects funded through government investment and stimulate non-government investment. Third, we will implement a structural tax reduction, and guide enterprise investment and consumer spending. We will build upon progress in VAT reform and the reform of taxes and fees on refined oil products. We will apply a preferential income tax policy to some small enterprises with low profits.

Asia is becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural and technological disasters as the region rushes toward industrialization, international experts told a conference here Wednesday. Gigantic infrastructure projects and towering buildings have altered the skylines in Asian capitals, increasing the risks of serious damage from flooding and earthquakes in a region in the centre of the Pacific ""ring of fire"", they said. The rise of megacities resulting from rural migration to the urban centers, along with environmental degradation, poor implementation of building laws and ill-planned development have led to the massive loss of lives and property damage during earthquakes and typhoons, they added. ""Increasing vulnerability is the most important problem we face today,"" Sanny Jegillos, a senior manager of the Bangkok-based Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, told over 200 delegates attending the three-day conference.

Haiti can take several steps to begin drawing in international development dollars, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide told the Bloomberg Forum. ``The first thing to be done is to create a climate of political stability,'' said Aristide, who was honored in New York by the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice for his role in returning Haiti to democracy. ``We also need to reform our judicial system, because when you invest, the government has to protect your rights, at the same time as it protects the rights of the workers,'' said Aristide, who was replaced by Rene Preval in February and has turned to running a democracy foundation. Haitian working conditions, which include a minimum wage of about 28 cents an hour, made headlines earlier this month when some Walt Disney Co. shareholders petitioned the company to monitor its small manufacturing contractors there more closely. Aristide said that Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere with a per capital annual gross national product of about $200, had to address the inequality of rich and poor before the economy could grow.

UPDATES with government saying they learned of problems only. In the fog-shrouded mountains of southern Mexico, armed gangs have held hundreds of Indian villagers in near-slavery for months, seizing their coffee harvests, imposing arbitrary fines and harassing those suspected of sympathizing with leftist rebels. The same gangs _ loyal to Mexico's ruling party _ are blamed for the massacre of 45 people a week ago in Chiapas state, where guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army have waged a 4-year-old insurgency aimed at securing rights for the region's poor Indians. On Saturday, convoys of heavily armed troops, church workers and volunteers rumbled along winding switchback roads through dense forests to escort 1,500 frightened Tzotzil Indians from at least three villages where the armed bands have ruled by threats and violence since March. ``They were subject to forced labor and extortion and they lived in fear,'' said Dominican priest and human rights activist Pablo Romo, who helped organize the caravan into Los Chorros, a village the gunmen used as a base.

XIN_ENG_20010318.0203,"Report on National Economic, Social Development Plans (9). The achievements scored in national economic and social development in 2000 were not come by easily. They were the result of the concerted efforts of the people throughout the country conscientiously following through on correct policy decisions made by the central authorities. These achievements marked the fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the attainment of the strategic objectives for the second stage of the modernization drive, thus laying a solid foundation for efforts to attain the strategic goals for the third stage. However, we are fully aware that there are still conflicts and problems in current economic and social activities that should not be overlooked. A mechanism for effecting the normal increase in effective demand has not been completely established. The base for economic recovery remains unstable. There is not enough investment activity in society. Although there has been some improvement in investment from the collective and private sectors and individual investors, this improvement has played only a limited role in the overall growth of investment in society. There are still some factors restricting growth of consumption. Efforts to expand consumption in rural markets need to be increased. The pattern of exports is irrational and quite a few commodities are poor competitors. Agriculture is vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters. The consistently low prices of agricultural products have slowed down the growth in the incomes of farmers and there has even been a drop in the incomes of farmers in some major grain producing areas. The industrial structure is still not very rational. Overproduction in ordinary processing industries is still a glaring problem and the proportion of emerging industries making significant use of technological advances is low. Regional economic development remains unbalanced. It will be no easy job to help the rural residents who are still impoverished to shake off poverty. There has still not been a fundamental change in the way state-owned enterprises operate. They are not in a position to make innovations and a number of them are having difficulty continuing to operate. Pressure to employment efforts is mounting in urban areas as more than 6 million workers laid off from state-owned enterprises have not yet found jobs. Total payments exceed new revenue for old-age insurance funds in some regions, making it difficult to pay retirees on old-age pensions. Income distribution has become increasingly irrational. Production and marketing of fake and shoddy goods, tax evasion and tax fraud, smuggling and obtaining foreign exchange under false pretenses have become rampant problems in some regions, leading to a general lack of credibility in society. Indiscipline in financial and economic affairs is still a problem despite repeated attempts to curb the problem. Abusing one's power for personal gains, corruption, extravagance and waste remain a serious problem among a small number of government functionaries. There are still many hidden hazards jeopardizing operating safety and catastrophic accidents are still causing serious damage to people's lives and property. The public order is not good in some regions.

We increased allocations to the State Natural Sciences Fund, the National Key Technology R&D Program and other research programs. We gave greater support to nonprofit research institutes and scientific research in nonprofit sectors. We also supported the building of a system of industrial technologies for modern agriculture, the establishment of a national platform to develop basic conditions for science and technology, and the creation of national laboratories and national key laboratories. We promoted reform of the system for managing research institutes. We encouraged independent innovation in small and medium-sized science and technology enterprises, launched a pilot project for venture capital investment, and formulated and implemented taxation policies to support the development of state university science parks and science and technology business incubators. 3. We gave more support for the building of a new socialist countryside. Funding for agricultural subsidies increased substantially. The central government spent 27.6 billion yuan, an increase of 130%, to provide farmers with general direct subsidies for buying agricultural production supplies. It also spent two billion yuan in subsidies for purchasing agricultural machinery and tools, up 233.3%, and 6.66 billion yuan in subsidies for growing superior grain varieties, up 60.5%. Direct subsidies to grain growers nationwide came to 15.1 billion yuan, and in 13 major grain- producing provinces and autonomous regions these subsidies accounted for more than 50% of those areas' grain risk funds. The government set price floors for the purchase of grain and bought 28.95 billion kilograms of wheat. The central government allocated 10.53 billion yuan to support the production of hogs, dairy products and oilseeds and ensure that supplies were adequate to meet demand. We carried out trials to subsidize insurance premiums for essential crops such as rice and wheat in six provinces and autonomous regions. We also supported programs to train 3.5 million rural workers for nonagricultural employment as well as scientific and technological training programs in 20,000 villages to foster a new type of farmer. Rural working and living conditions were improved. The central government spent 19.46 billion yuan to continue funding the construction of six categories of small rural projects [water- efficient irrigation, potable water supplies, road building, methane production facilities, hydroelectric plants, and pasture enclosure, Tr.] and another 4.2 billion yuan to build small water conservancy facilities and renovate small, dilapidated reservoirs. A total of 11.57 billion yuan was spent to promote overall development of agriculture, resulting in 1.57 million hectares of low- and medium-yield farmland being upgraded and high-grade arable land being cultivated, and in three billion kilograms of grain production capacity being added last year. Part of this sum also went to 1,457 projects to make agricultural operations more industrial. An additional 17.2 billion yuan paid out to the central government in compensation for land converted to development purposes was used to develop and protect primary farmland, improve land and cultivate arable land. One billion yuan was appropriated to promote the development of farmers' specialized cooperatives and the dissemination of agricultural science and technology. In addition, 1.29 billion yuan was spent to improve the distribution of goods and develop the market system in the countryside. Support was given to fight natural disasters, provide disaster relief and reduce poverty through development. In response to serious natural disasters in 2007, the central government promptly appropriated 13.3 billion yuan for disaster relief, supplemented by generous appropriations from local governments. To intensify poverty reduction through development, the central government spent 14.4 billion yuan mainly in poor areas in the central and western regions. We also made innovations in working mechanisms, which made our poverty reduction efforts even more effective.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.20440460434689167

Action Plan of China(2009-2010)(2). Over the past year, the Chinese government has adopted a series of major policies and measures, such as expanding domestic demand, restructuring economy, promoting economic growth and improving people's livelihood. The government has taken positive measures to properly cope with the international financial crisis, and has maintained sound yet rapid economic and social growth, thus effectively safeguarded people's rights to subsistence and development as well as their economic, social and cultural rights. Over this year, China has promulgated laws and regulations, including the law on intermediation and arbitration over land contract disputes in rural areas, the Food Safety Law, the regulation on the implementation of the Food Safety Law, and the regulation on fitness for all. China has also made amendments to the Labor Law, the Law on Education, the Law on Agriculture, the Law on Land Contract in Rural Areas, the Flood Control Law, and the Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, guaranteeing citizens' economic, social and cultural rights to greater extent. Meanwhile, the government has taken forceful measures to address issues that have direct bearing on people's well-being, such as employment, health care, social security, increasing farmers' income, education, production safety, prevention against communicable diseases such as A/H1N1 influenza, so that people's rights in various areas have been effectively safeguarded on the basis of steady and fast economic growth. According to statistics, over the first nine months this year, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.7 percent; income of urban and rural residents increased by 10.5 percent and 9.2 percent respectively. About 8.51 million urban residents became employed, 4.02 million laid-off workers reemployed, and 1.2 million people having difficulty in finding jobs employed in the same period. China has been actively promoting the reform of the household registration system, relaxing limits on getting such registrations in small and medium cities. Various channels have been created to get farmers employed in non-farming sectors, and migrant workers' rights and interests have been safeguarded. By the end of September, there had been 152 million migrant workers across the nation, rallying to the level before the global financial crisis. In 2009, 19.73 billion yuan from the central budget were used in poverty reduction, up by 3 billion yuan from last year, and both the growth rate and increment were the highest ever since 1998. A total of  4.13 billion yuan was poured into poverty reduction loan funds. Meanwhile, rural poverty reduction subsidies have been raised to 1,196 yuan per person, covering 40.07 million rural needy people. Poverty reduction measures will apply to all low-income groups in rural areas. Social insurance system has improved, all social insurance compensation being paid in time and in full. The population covered by basic old age insurances, basic health insurances, employment, work injury and children-bearing insurances, and population of migrant workers covered by social insurances have all expanded. By the end of September, the population covered by basic health insurance had reached 362.95 million, 44.74 million more than that of last year. The population covered by new rural cooperative health insurances reached 833 million, 16 million more than that at the end of last year, the coverage ratio staying above 90 percent.

We convert the stands of the Party into the will of the state through legally defined procedures and cement the lessons learned through our achievements in reform, opening up and socialist modernization into law in accordance with the strategic arrangements and major resolutions of the Party and the state and based on what we have learned in the great process of reform and opening up and of socialist modernization. In formulating legislation, we take into consideration the objective needs of economic and social development and focus on legislative items that can play an important role in the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, that meet pressing needs in the social life of the country and for which conditions are ripe for passing. In addition to improving legislation concerning economic matters, we also concentrate on improving legislation concerning social issues, and in addition to passing new legislation, we also attach great importance to revising and improving current legislation. Following these principles, a number of important legislative tasks were completed. In line with the suggestions concerning revision of the Constitution submitted by the CPC Central Committee, we deliberated and passed the amended Constitution, which confirms the guiding role of the important thought of Three Represents in the social life of the country, includes the major theoretical viewpoints and important principles and policies defined at the Sixteenth National Congress, clarifies the country's respect and protection for human rights and its protection of the rights of citizens to hold property and receive an inheritance. This fully reflects the unity of the CPC's stands and the will of the people and represents another major milestone in China's constitutional history. We formulated the Anti-Secession Law, which provides the legal framework for the major policies, principles and policy measures of the Party and the state for work related to Taiwan. The law fully reflects our consistent position that we are most sincere and are doing our utmost to bring about the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. At the same time, this legislation reflects the common will and firm resolution of the entire Chinese nation to never allow anyone in any guise or in any way to separate Taiwan from the motherland and to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This legislation provides firm legal backing for the struggle to oppose and keep in check separatist activities aimed at Taiwan independence and promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We formulated interpretations and passed corresponding decisions concerning some articles in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its annexes in line with the original legislative intentions of the Basic Law. This played an irreplaceable role in ensuring the correct implementation of the Basic Law, promoting the healthy development of democracy in Hong Kong and safeguarding the region's long-term prosperity and stability. We formulated the Law on Oversight, improving the forms and procedures for oversight by the standing committees of people's congresses at all levels and effectively helping to institutionalize, standardize and define procedures for oversight work for the people's congresses. We formulated the Civil Servant Law in conformity with the Party's line, principles and policies on cadres, providing a strong legal footing for reform of the personnel and cadre system. We comprehensively improved economic legislation to meet objective requirements for developing China's socialist market economy. We enacted the Law on Property Rights in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, specifying rules for resolving some common issues related to the system of property rights. Pursuing the purposes of clarifying property ownership, maximizing the utility of property, and protecting the rights of property owners, the Law on Property Rights has further improved the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics concerning property rights. In line with the normal rule in the market that better companies survive and poor companies fall by the wayside, we formulated the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, which applies to all types of corporations. This standardizes procedures for enterprise bankruptcy and establishes a legal framework for the orderly withdrawal of enterprises from the market. We formulated the Antitrust Law in line with conditions in China, setting up a legal framework suitable for China's current stage of economic development to prevent and stop monopolies and to safeguard and promote fair competition. This law will help safeguard economic order in the market, protect the rights and interests of consumers and promote advances in technology. In order to tighten financial regulation and preserve the financial order, we formulated the Banking Oversight and Management Law and the Law to Combat Money Laundering and revised the Law on the People's Bank of China, the Law on Commercial Banks and the Securities Law, thus improving the legal framework for banking and financial activities. The Law on Corporate Income Tax, which was formulated to meet the goals of reform of the taxation system, unifies the income tax rates for domestic and overseas-funded enterprises and standardizes pre-tax deductions and favorable tax policies. The Individual Income Tax Law was revised three times, reducing the tax load on low- and medium- income wage earners and tightening tax collection and management for high-income persons. We made the decision to eliminate the Regulations on the Agricultural Tax, ending the 2,000-year history of farmers paying taxes in China and taking an important step toward unifying the tax systems for cities and the countryside. We formulated the Law on Specialized Farmer Cooperatives, which is of great significance for the effort to increase the level of organization of farmers and promote industrialized operation of agriculture. In addition, we formulated the Law on Renewable Energy, revised the Law on Energy Conservation and deliberated the Law on the Circular Economy (draft) and other laws related to resources and the environment.

NYT_ENG_19950201.0352,"FOREIGN AID, IN MODERATION. Foreign aid, never very popular with Americans, is on the chopping block. It is not easy to argue the merits of federal spending to diminish poverty, hunger and disease abroad when budget cuts mean inadequate funding for those problems at home. But some substantial benefits for the U.S. can be secured by relatively inexpensive foreign aid programs that are carefully selected and managed. Aid that directly attacks the causes of global insecurity like poverty, disease, overpopulation and environmental degradation can prevent the sort of political instability and humanitarian disasters that ultimately require more costly American involvement. If the budget-cutters are not careful, they may shortchange aid to those who need it most and where it may do the most good. Of the $12.3 billion in the current aid budget, more than half goes to programs that directly reduce risks to U.S. security -- $3 billion to Israel and $2.1 billion to Egypt to promote peace in the Middle East, and $1.2 billion to the former Soviet bloc to encourage transitions to democracy and markets. Republican leaders in Congress have pledged to sustain these efforts. If that position prevails, most of the cuts will come from the $4.2 billion that benefits the poorest of the poor, especially in Africa, and has helped turn around countries like Zimbabwe and Botswana. That aid is being redirected to small projects, often disbursed by development banks or non-governmental organizations, to better the lives of millions -- like immunizing children in Kenya and Honduras and introducing new agricultural techniques that may yet allow Bangladesh to feed itself. If carefully targeted, aid can help promote peaceful transitions in South Africa and Zaire.","{'disasters', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor'}",0.1995541311463681
NYT_ENG_20020412.0025,"EDITORIAL: THE GRAYING OF THE GLOBE. The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 12: A U.N. conference in Madrid, Spain, has been grappling all week with the implications of a startling demographic development _ a world where there will be more elderly people than youngsters in coming decades. The developed nations passed through that transition a few years ago, prompting today's concerns over the adequacy of social security retirement programs and of health care for the aged in the world's richest nations. But now the developing world, poorer and less prepared to cope, is heading in the same direction. By the year 2050, demographers estimate, the world as a whole will contain more people aged 60 and older than children under the age of 15. It will be one of the most dramatic demographic shifts in history. From one perspective, the graying of the planet is a huge success story, brought about by social and medical advances that are allowing people to live much longer and by population control programs that have cut birth rates not only in the rich countries but in poorer nations as well. But from another perspective, the transition will bring problems that will need urgent attention. Delegates to this week's World Assembly on Aging are focusing, quite rightly, on the need to reduce the overwhelming poverty that is the main threat to older people in developing nations. They need the basics: nourishing food, clean water, clothing and housing. Once those are provided, there is the problem in all societies of subsidizing health care and retirement benefits for the elderly when there are proportionately fewer workers to support them. Older people will need to remain active, healthy and economically productive, especially in poor nations with no social safety net. On the darker side, delegates are seeking ways to curtail physical, sexual and psychological abuse of the elderly, as well as the looting of their property. But perhaps the most needed change is attitudinal. The world will have to start thinking of its older citizens less as a burden on society and more as a resource whose experience and knowledge can be tapped, for the benefit of themselves and the societies they live in.","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'property', 'social security', 'development', 'poor'}",0.19936875089859654

NYT_ENG_20070620.0176,"FAST-GROWING CHINA SAYS LITTLE OF CHILD SLAVERY ' S ROLE MEMO FROM SHANGHAI. There is a certain ritualistic aspect to stories in China like the one this past week about the hundreds of people, many of them teenagers or even younger, who were forced to work under slavelike conditions in the brick kilns of Shanxi Province. First, Chinese readers are horrified by a picture of their country that many say they hardly recognize, then a villain is rounded up, and finally, after a torrent of unusually blunt and emotionally charged news reports and editorials, the matter drops from view, ensuring that the larger issue goes unresolved. The villain in the case was Heng Tinghan, the manager of the brick works, who was arrested Saturday and promptly cemented his bad-guy image by protesting that it was a ""fairly small thing"" to beat and abuse underage workers, and to deprive them of pay. With his arrest, and the urging of the Central Office of External Communication of the Communist Party, the story then died away. But Chinese newspapers are constantly peppered with accounts of the death and injury of child laborers, and of disputes that arise because of unusually low wages, or the withholding of pay, with no region of the country exempted. Just within a week or so of the brick kiln story, there were several reports of labor abuses against children. A 14-year-old boy was killed in an explosion while filling a tank with napthalene at a chemical factory near Nanjing. A 15-year-old boy was dragged into a cotton gin and crushed to death in Nanchang after working a succession of 20-hour days. And 70 girls from rural Henan Province were brought by their teacher to work at a grape processing plant in Ningbo, where their hands bled from working 16-hour shifts. From the densely packed factory zones of Guangdong Province to the street markets, kitchens and brothels of major cities, to the primitive factories of China's relatively poor western provinces, child labor is a daily fact of life, experts here say, and one that the government, preoccupied with economic growth, has traditionally turned a blind eye to. ""In order to achieve modernization, people will go to any ends to earn money, to advance their interests, leaving behind morality, humanity and even a little bit of compassion, let alone the law or regulations, which are poorly implemented,"" said Hu Jindou, a professor of economics at the University of Technology in Beijing. ""Everything is about the economy now, just like everything was about politics in the Mao era, and forced labor or child labor is far from an isolated phenomenon. It is rooted deeply in today's reality, a combination of capitalism, socialism, feudalism and slavery.""","{'workers', 'child labor', 'low wage', 'slavery', 'poor'}",0.19694268532156886

For the man inclined to cheat on his wife, these are trying times. Keeping a mistress, visiting a prostitute or even taking a girlfriend out for beers is simply becoming too expensive, men say. But their strain is Zimbabwe's gain in its fight against AIDS. Alone among southern African countries, Zimbabwe has shown a significant drop in its HIV rate in recent years. A major reason, researchers say, is the changing sexual habits of men forced to abandon costly multiple relationships. ``Those extramarital relationships, they're getting tough to sustain,'' said Thomas Muza, 37, who is struggling to support his wife and a mistress on the shrinking value of a math teacher's paycheck. Worth $50 a month at the beginning of June, it's now worth $17 and falling almost every day. AIDS activists and some researchers long blamed the continent's high poverty rates for its unusually widespread HIV epidemics, arguing that poor medical care and hunger made Africans especially vulnerable to the virus, while financial need accelerated its spread by pushing women into prostitution. Yet Zimbabwe's experience shows that the connection between AIDS and economics is not nearly so straightforward. The country has made strides against HIV during eight years of steep recession. Wealthier neighbors such as South Africa and Botswana, meanwhile, have struggled to curb new infections despite much higher levels of development and massive spending on the disease.","{'control', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor'}",0.19522987275613352

Times News Service I don't know what made Cicih Sukaesih, an Indonesian factory worker, think the Clinton administration would want to hear from her. She must have been dreaming. Her fellow Indonesians James and Mochtar Riady could have told her the score. Access costs money. You need really big bucks to guarantee that you'll get a hearing in Washington, and Cicih (pronounced CHEE-chee) had no money at all. I suspect that the Riadys, who purchased their own little corner of the administration, would have had a good chuckle over Cicih's ignorance. After all, the Riadys' main man in Washington, John Huang, had virtually unlimited access to the White House. He might as well have had a key. Cicih's situation was somewhat different. Cicih came to the United States last summer to spread the word about the plight of overworked and underpaid Indonesian sweatshop workers. She was one of 24 employees who had been fired from their jobs at a factory making Nike athletic shoes because they had demanded they be paid the legally required minimum wage. Her trip to the United States was arranged by a labor activist named Jeffrey Ballinger and a San Francisco-based human rights group called Global Exchange. The trip was timed to coincide with an anti-sweatshop extravaganza put on by the Clinton administration at Marymount College in Arlington, Va. Called the ``Fashion Industry Forum,'' the idea was to bring together celebrity endorsers like Kathie Lee Gifford and Cheryl Tiegs, executives from big-name corporations (Wal-Mart, Liz Claiborne, Nordstrom et al), and labor and consumer representatives.

Such immense energy went into drafting an almost irrelevant statement because the relationship between labor conditions and world trade is inherently in conflict -- and of huge importance to the future of the world's increasingly globalized economy. The key economic advantage poor countries bring to world trade, which enables them to compete at all with richer societies, is the low wages -- sometimes extremely low wages -- of most of their workers. Under such conditions, violations of internationally recognized ideals, such as the abuse of child labor, are not uncommon. Thus the debate here was simply the opening round within the world's premier trade organization of what is sure to be decades of argument.

""But worse than this is the inequitable use of resources. The south has a rich heritage of resources but these are controlled by the countries of the north.

XIN_ENG_20040316.0383,"Report on China's economic and social development plan (full text-6). At present, exercising appropriate control over the scale of fixed assets investment and rigorously curbing haphazard investment and low-level, redundant construction in some industries and regions constitute both an important task for industrial restructuring and a pressing need to keep economic growth stable and rapid and free from drastic fluctuations. We will strengthen and improve macro-control, and guided by the market, we will use mainly economic and legal means supplemented by administrative means to guide and promote sound development of the iron and steel, electrolytic aluminum and cement industries. We will vigorously encourage mergers and regrouping in these industries, support enterprises that can benefit from economies of scale to expand rapidly, and allow market forces to determine their success or failure. We will put into practice all regulatory measures set forth in the Report on the Work of the Government for providing guidance through state policy and planning and industrial information, tightening market access and strengthening management of land use and credit. We must work hard to alleviate bottlenecks in economic development. We will accelerate development of large coal mines and the coal transport system, so as to increase the coal supply without compromising production safety. We will continue developing power generating facilities and power grids in accordance with the principle of giving priority to building power generating capacity and ensuring its rational distribution. In 2004, construction will be started on power plants with a combined capacity of 40 million KW, new power generating capacity of 37 million KW will come on line, and desulphurization equipment will be built simultaneously as required. We will improve management of power grids and the demand for power to ensure a safe power supply. We will properly organize the production and import of crude and processed oil and speed up the building of a national strategic oil reserve. We will better regulate economic operations in accordance with the laws of the market to balance supply and demand in coal, electricity, oil, transport capacity and important raw and processed materials. We will develop more trunk lines and transportation hubs. The basic way to alleviate the disparity between supply and demand in coal, electricity, oil, transport capacity and important raw and processed materials is to increase the supply as much as possible and at the same time to effectively change the pattern of economic growth, restructure the economy, and restrict haphazard development of industries and enterprises that waste energy and resources and cause serious pollution and to encourage all industries to save energy and eliminate waste. 4. Implementing a proactive employment policy and continuing to expand consumer spending and improve people's lives. We will further implement existing measures such as fiscal and credit support and tax and fee cuts and exemptions and do everything possible to create more jobs. We will give full play to the role of labor-intensive industries, small and medium-sized enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy in expanding employment. We will vigorously develop the tertiary industry and expand avenues for employment in traditional service industries such as business, food and beverage service and transportation. We will create more jobs in the areas of public health, urban environmental protection, medical care, as well as community and domestic services. We will expand employment in tourism, education, training, culture, sports and information services. We will promote diverse types of employment and encourage people to be flexible in taking a job or become self-employed. We will improve the employment service system, strengthen the reemployment assistance system and provide better job training, job introduction and employment guidance services to laid-off workers and the unemployed. We will work harder at job placement for college graduates and ex-servicemen. We will improve the consumer environment, expand consumer spending and gradually increase the proportion of consumption in our GDP. While doing everything possible to increase rural incomes, we will improve commodity distribution facilities and commercial outlets in rural areas and develop infrastructure facilities there such as those for water, power and roads, thus creating conditions for rural residents to expand their consumption. We will continue to implement the ""three-stage guarantee"" and ensure that the living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and the pensions of retirees are paid on time and in full. We will improve the social assistance system, provide subsistence allowances to the urban poor and help needy urban families solve their practical problems. We will increase the supply of low- and moderate-price commercial housing, stimulate the secondary housing market and expand consumer spending on housing. We will vigorously develop urban public transport services. We will steadily increase consumer spending on private cars and communications. We will encourage people to spend more on travel, sports, fitness and culture. We will accelerate the development of the credit system and develop consumer credit. We must combine efforts to expand consumption with those to strengthen regulation of income distribution. We will raise the minimum wage appropriately to increase the incomes of urban residents, especially low- and middle-income people. We need to strengthen supervision over income distribution in monopoly industries and intensify collection and management of individual income tax to regulate excessively high incomes. 5. Increasing revenue, reducing expenditures and ensuring steady and sound financial operations. We will improve tax collection and management and crack down on tax evasion and tax fraud to ensure steady revenue growth. We will adjust the pattern of budgetary expenditures and tighten control over them. We will focus on increasing funding to solve the problems facing agriculture, rural areas and farmers and to support employment work, social security, education, science, culture and health. We must ensure that government employees' salaries and government retirees' pensions are paid on time and in full, and that state organs receive the funding necessary for their normal operations. We will continue to have zero growth in our general expenditures. Total national revenue in the budget for 2004 is 2.357 trillion yuan and total expenditures are 2.6768 trillion yuan. This keeps the central government budget deficit within 319.8 billion yuan. (More)","{'minimum wage', 'workers', 'control', 'social security', 'development', 'poor'}",0.1826433302323306

We should implement the strategy of market diversification, bring into play our comparative advantages, consolidate our existing markets and open new ones in an effort to increase exports. We should sharpen the competitive edge of our goods and services for export by ensuring good quality. We should optimize our import mix and focus on bringing in advanced technology and key equipment. We should deepen the reform of the system of trade and economic relations with other countries, encouraging more enterprises to engage in foreign trade and improving relevant taxation systems and the trade financing mechanism. We should attract more foreign direct investment and use it more effectively. We will open the service sector to the outside world step by step. We will utilize medium- and long-term foreign investment in many ways, combining it with the domestic economic restructuring and the reorganization and transformation of state- owned enterprises and encouraging multinational corporations to invest in agriculture and manufacturing and high and new technology industries. We should try to bring in from overseas large numbers of professionals and other intellectual resources in various areas. We should improve the environment for investment, grant national treatment to foreign investors and make relevant policies and regulations more transparent. Implementation of the strategy of ""going out"" is an important measure taken in the new stage of opening up. We should encourage and help relatively competitive enterprises with various forms of ownership to invest abroad in order to increase export of goods and labor services and bring about a number of strong multinational enterprises and brand names. We should take an active part in regional economic exchanges and cooperation. In opening wider to the outside world, we must pay great attention to safeguarding our national economic security. 8. Do everything possible to create more jobs and improve the people's lives. Employment has a vital bearing on the people's livelihood. The task of increasing employment is arduous now and will remain so for a long time to come. It is a long-term strategy and policy of the state to expand employment. Party committees and governments at all levels must take it as their major obligation to improve the business environment and create more jobs. We should open up more avenues for employment and develop labor- intensive industries. We should give policy support to enterprises that increase jobs or reemploy laid-off workers. We should help the general public to change their mentality about employment, introduce flexible and diverse forms of employment and encourage people to find jobs on their own or become self-employed. We should improve the system of pre-job training and employment services and raise workers' skills for new jobs. We should strengthen employment management in accordance with law, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers, pay great attention to safety at work and protect the safety of state property and people's life. The fundamental goal of economic development is to uplift the living standards and quality of life of the people. As the economy develops, we should increase the income of urban and rural residents, expand the scope of their consumption and optimize the consumption structure so as to meet the people's multifarious material and cultural needs. Further efforts should be made to develop public service facilities, better people's living environment and expand community services in order to make life easier for the people. We should establish a medical service and health care system that meets the requirements of the new situation. We should improve medical and health conditions in rural areas and the medical and health care for urban and rural residents. We should build up various programs to help the handicapped. We should intensify our efforts to fight poverty through development, build on the achievements we have scored in this regard, strive to accomplish the task of providing adequate food and clothing f or the impoverished rural population and gradually enable them to lead a well-off life.

Even in the more traditional Haiti operation, U.S. troops were called upon to restore an ousted, democratically elected president who vowed to combat poverty rather than to take up arms in a classic government-to-government confrontation like the wars in Korean and Vietnam. The administration says the American people care about the problems addressed recently. ``The issues of overpopulation, of refugees, of famine, of human rights problems are issues the American people have become more interested in,'' said one National Security Council official. This shift toward softer intelligence has brought with it another shift: more than ever before, the intelligence community is using public material, particularly relief reports produced by organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross.","{'famine', 'disasters', 'poverty', 'human rights', 'natural disaster'}",0.1771541710905274

Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move on this circuit in expanded form: HONG KONG (AP) _ Tokyo and Hong Kong led sharp falls on Asian stock markets Wednesday, trigged by a tumble on Wall Street, worries over rising tensions in Yugoslavia and expectations of poor annual earnings results. Analysts across the region said investors were using the overnight drop in New York as an excuse to sell shares, which some believed had become overpriced in the recent rally through Asia Pacific exchanges. ``They felt the market had overheated,'' said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of Okasan Securities, in Tokyo. Tokyo shares, having rallied on renewed hopes of an imminent economic recovery, suffered a second straight day of dramatic falls. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 503.63 points, of 3.1 percent, to end the day at 15,515.47. On Tuesday, the average closed down 359.68 points, or 2.2 percent. (ASIAN MARKETS) BERLIN (AP) _ European Union leaders opened a summit Wednesday to sort out future funding of their club, seeking a long-delayed deal to finance the entry of a dozen new countries into the EU's ranks. But as the 15 EU leaders gathered at a posh downtown hotel, divisions remained after nearly two years of bargaining over how to curb spending in the 2000-2006 period. And German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the summit's host, faced a tough job in keeping minds focused on money. Only hours before the summit began, NATO cleared the way for allied airstrikes against Yugoslavia after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's last-ditch efforts failed to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept an international peace plan for Kosovo. (EU-SUMMIT) PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Encouraged by newfound peace and political stability, Prime Minister Hun Sen predicted Wednesday that Cambodia will soon achieve high economic growth and reach a level of development similar to its prosperous Southeast Asian neighbors within a few decades. At the close of the National Bank of Cambodia's annual conference, Hun Sen targeted a growth rate of 6 to 7 percent he said would initially be dependent on the poverty-stricken nation's ability to attract foreign aid and investment. The prime minister said Cambodia would follow in the development paths of regional economic dynamos Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, while working to avoid the mistakes that led to the recent Asian financial crisis. ``Thanks to high economic growth during almost the last 30 years, the economic structure and image of these countries changed considerably,'' Hun Sen told conference participants. (CAMBODIA-ECONOMY) BEIJING (AP) _ A court has rejected the appeal of a software entrepreneur sentenced to two years imprisonment in China's first Internet subversion case, a human rights group said Wednesday. The Higher People's Court in Lin Hai's home city of Shanghai turned down the 30-year-old's appeal Monday, nearly two months after it was filed, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Lin was arrested last March after giving the e-mail addresses of 30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a pro-democracy journal published on the Internet by Chinese dissidents in the United States. He stood trial Dec. 4 in a closed courtroom and was sentenced Jan. 20 for ``inciting the overthrow of state power.'' Lin appealed the verdict. His conviction was widely criticized by human rights and press freedom groups. (CHINA-INTERNET TRIAL)","{'entrepreneur', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'human rights'}",0.17681418383720682

LTW_ENG_20050115.0010,"After the Tsunami. The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: The unprecedented generosity in response to Asia's tsunami has reflected the sense that this is a different sort of tragedy. Many disasters in poor countries are caused or exacerbated by human failings: Famines often are created by war; tornadoes kill people in large numbers where authorities have failed to plan for them; the long-term problems of poverty frequently reflect corrupt or incompetent leadership. But the tsunami was an act of nature that rose up from the ocean; although helter-skelter development of coastal areas may have compounded the damage, the people of rich countries perceived the tsunami as a case of pure misfortune. And so the charitable response has been enormous. The success of the relief effort, by contrast, is bound to depend on the competence of governments. National pride may prove an obstacle: India's government refused foreign help, and then was slow to deliver assistance to the remote Andaman Islands; Indonesia's government has forbidden U.S. Marines from staying overnight on its soil, which has restricted the U.S. role in clearing rubble and in reconstruction; Burma's dictators as usual seem more interested in preserving their positions than allowing help to reach their citizens. Indonesia has also announced that foreign aid workers must register with its officials before leaving the two main towns in Aceh, a requirement that may become onerous if implemented restrictively. Beyond the question of national pride, government leadership of reconstruction can be good, bad or indifferent. One of the mistakes made in previous disasters was to allow feeding camps to spring up far from people's dwellings; this separated survivors from their pre-disaster lives and delayed their return to self-sufficiency. That's why it has been essential to deliver relief supplies to people in remote regions rather than forcing those people to trek into the towns in search of help. Helicopter drops of food, coupled with an urgent effort to re-establish road links so that traders can move goods, have rightly been early priorities. Another potential mistake is to allow a flood of foreign help to destroy local coping mechanisms. Food aid may be essential in the immediate aftermath of a disaster but can drive local food prices down if sustained for too long, hurting local producers. Conversely, an inflow of foreign money can drive local prices up to the detriment of consumers. Policymakers must steer a path down the middle. Aid must also be distributed to reach the most vulnerable groups, because famines and medical shortages often reflect not an absolute scarcity but rather a lack of purchasing power among the poorest. If supplies are simply dropped from a helicopter, some will muscle their way forward and walk off with them, selling them to those compatriots who can afford them.","{'famine', 'disasters', 'workers', 'vulnerable', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.17496779436637172

LTW_ENG_19951017.0035,"When Disasters Make Hotel Guests Feel Like Hostages. It was a dark and stormy day. I was due to fly from Los Cabos International Airport in Baja California to Los Angeles. But several hours before my flight was to depart, with the rain falling sideways and hotel workers boarding up windows and heaving patio furniture out of the wind's path and into the pool, authorities closed down the airport for the day. Hurricane Ismael seemed to be coming soon, they said. I was grounded, along with several hundred other American travelers, for an extra unanticipated night. As it turned out, the hurricane veered toward mainland Mexico around Los Mochis, killing about 100 people in gusting winds and violent surf. But like thousands of travelers caught in this year's hurricanes in the Caribbean and elsewhere, we in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas had an awkward and potentially expensive situation to sort out: If a weather emergency forces you to stay an extra night in your hotel, or evacuate early, who pays? How much? Cruise lines, which routinely face the need to steer around rough weather, have a standard clause in their passenger agreements that grants them freedom to change itineraries (though that doesn't always keep passengers from protesting). Some hotels in New York, Boston, Chicago and other snow-prone cities have discounts for snowed-in travelers. And travelers who buy trip cancellation/interruption insurance coverage are usually covered when natural disasters scramble plans. But most travelers don't have that coverage, and most vacation destination hotels don't have much practice in setting natural-disaster rates. Thus, as word of our stranding circulated among the guests at the Melia Cabo Real Beach Golf Resort in San Jose del Cabo that day, there were a lot of questions in the air. Some of my fellow guests made loud noises about how they expected a free night since this was beyond their control. Others kept quiet, recognizing that the weather was beyond the hotel's control too. Having just arrived after spending several nights in a nearby small town, I didn't expect any great favors as a new guest checking into the hotel under storm-watch conditions. And I didn't get any. Though the Melia Cabo Real, a 300-room Hyatt-like property, was mostly unoccupied and its services and amenities were severely curtailed, the lowest nightly rate I could get was about $115 -- the hotel's usual price for a single room in September. More important, however, is what the hotel did for the guests who had been at the hotel for a day or more and had expected to leave that night. Management gave them the night free. Diego Montoya, the hotel's front desk manager, later estimated that 60 guests were offered the free night.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'control', 'property', 'natural disaster'}",0.17206005862752374
NYT_ENG_19980630.0298,"CLINTON TO OBSERVE CHANGE IN CHINA HOUSING POLICY. Here in an unremarkable, pink-trimmed, five-story apartment complex that President Clinton visits Wednesday, a revolution has begun that will likely transform China's economy, culture and politics in ways its communist founders wouldn't recognize. Starting Wednesday in a policy to be phased in by the year's end, the government will no longer provide virtually free housing to urban workers, and families will have to purchase homes or lease state-owned apartments at much higher rents. But that also means that for the first time since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, between 200 million and 300 million urban Chinese will be able to live wherever and as comfortably as they can afford. ``In the old days, we were assigned homes by our work units and it was sometimes unfair. Powerful people in the unit got better homes'' and people could not move or change jobs because they were tied to assigned housing, said Fan Xiaoyang, a 37-year-old futures trader who recently bought an apartment with the help of a mortgage loan, a new concept in China. ``Now, however good or bad our house is depends on our ability. We can finally control it.'' Home ownership has long been central to the American Dream, but in China the implications go far beyond the notion of family security and the chance to accumulate equity. Housing reform, perhaps more than any other change to the planned economy, will fundamentally alter life in China by giving people control over their lives at the most basic level. Of course, the picture is not entirely rosy. Millions of workers are so poor that they can barely manage higher rents, much less buy. Countless others who are being forcibly relocated far from soon-to-be-demolished state apartments to make way for shiny new developments for the rich. Even so, for most people, housing reform will mean more living space and better facilities than ever before.","{'workers', 'control', 'development', 'poor', 'ownership'}",0.17077482026823557

LTW_ENG_20050811.0011,"Wanted: A Famine Fund. The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: Humanitarian crises are seldom just humanitarian: Almost always, the malnutrition and the misery have political causes. The brutal wars in Sudan and Congo account for those countries' appalling civilian death tolls. Political repression explains the hunger in North Korea and Zimbabwe. Even the HIV pandemic reflects the failure of politicians to challenge gender inequality and sexual taboos. Niger's food crisis has its own political dimension. The government has been criticized for playing down the crisis -- it speaks of a food shortage rather than a famine -- and for resisting calls to distribute free food. International financial institutions, which urged a value-added tax on food and imposed budget controls that discouraged the government from maintaining emergency food stocks, also deserve some of the blame. Even so, Niger's crisis is less political than many. This landlocked country of about 11 million is a democracy. There is no war going on there. Some 2.5 million people need emergency assistance because of natural disasters more than politics: a swarm of locusts that ate much of the millet harvest, followed by a drought. Usually, natural disasters attract a generous response. The tsunami last Christmas was a prime example, and earthquakes and hurricanes generally prompt individuals and their governments to open their wallets -- or at least to pledge generously, even if they don't always deliver. But Niger has not even been that fortunate. As early as last November, the government and the U.N. World Food Program appealed for emergency food aid and money; only Luxembourg responded. The United Nations followed up with a second appeal in March and a third in May. Only recently has the money begun to come. If Niger's largely unpolitical emergency cannot trigger prompt sympathy, it's time to rethink the way relief is organized. The world depends on an ad hoc, pass-the-hat system; there's no standing ability to respond quickly when the first signs of disaster appear. This raises the cost of action. In the Sudanese province of Darfur last year, donors didn't provide enough relief before the onset of the rainy season, so part of their belated assistance had to be airlifted into the region at enormous expense. Similarly in Niger, the United Nations estimates that saving a life would have cost a dollar of aid back in November but may cost $80 or more now.","{'famine', 'disasters', 'control', 'hunger', 'natural disaster'}",0.16993953085962882

Following the principle of ""being prompt and precise, open and transparent,"" the central and local governments are expected to work in earnest on the emergency information release work concerning natural disasters and other emergencies, offering through authorized releases, press releases, interviews and press conferences to the public prompt information on the disasters and their developments, progress of emergency response work, disaster prevention, and knowledge on disaster prevention and other information, thus ensuring the public's rights to know and supervise. -- Relief materials reserve system. China has built a relief materials reserve network based on special storehouses, which has seen year-on-year improvements. The country has now ten such storehouses for daily necessities at the central level, and storage centers for relief supply, flood and forest fire control supplies are continuously being built and improved. Coupled with the reserve relief supply centers established in some provinces, cities and counties, a preliminary disaster control and relief materials reserve system has taken shape. To guarantee the timely purchase of relief supplies, a list of commissioned relief supply manufacturers is established, and emergency purchase agreements signed with them for the supply of relief materials in case of emergency. -- Disaster early warning, consultation and information sharing mechanism. A disaster early warning, consultation and information sharing mechanism has been set up, involving such relevant departments as civil affairs, land and resources, water resources, agriculture, forestry, statistics, seismology, maritime affairs and meteorology. To offer timely and effective support for the decision-making of the central government and local departments in case of emergency, China has initiated the construction of a disaster information database and launched a public platform of national geographical information and a disaster information publishing and sharing system, as well as a platform for national disaster reduction and risk management information. -- Major disaster rescue and relief joint coordination mechanism. In the wake of a major disaster, relevant departments will play their functions and timely dispatch to disaster-hit areas working groups composed of personnel from these departments to gather first-hand information and guide disaster control and relief work on the spot. The groups are also required by the State Council to coordinate with the relevant departments to map out rescue plans, help with disaster relief work and prevent possible secondary disasters. -- Disaster emergency response public mobilization mechanism. A preliminary public mobilization system is now in place, focusing on efforts for rescue, search, first aid, relief, donation and other work. The government also gives full scope to non- government organizations, such as mass organizations, the Red Cross, self-governmental organizations at the grassroots level and individual volunteers in the fields of disaster prevention, emergency rescue, relief and donation work, medical, hygiene and quarantine work, post-disaster reconstruction, psychological support and other aspects.

LTW_ENG_20060518.0102,"Bolivia Plans to Redistribute Idle Farmland. Two weeks after claiming control of the natural gas and oil under Bolivia's soil, the government of President Evo Morales has turned its attention above ground, launching a plan to redistribute parcels of idle farmland to the poor. Officials announced Tuesday that they would start by redistributing about 12 million acres of state-owned land to indigenous rural workers. But officials say that amount could eventually triple if more privately held lands are declared unproductive, a prospect that some fear could inflame the divisions between rich and poor that have contributed to conflicts between Bolivia's east and west. Morales sailed to victory in elections in December denouncing the inequality of Bolivia's economy, saying that money and resources flow downhill from the western highlands, populated largely by indigenous groups, and settle in the relatively wealthy lowlands of the east. Morales described his energy nationalization plan as an attempt to distribute income from national resources more equitably; the land reform plan is a continuation of that strategy. Officials do not plan to confiscate property from ``anyone who has legally obtained the land and who works on it every day and makes it productive,'' Hugo Salvatierra, the minister for rural development, told reporters Tuesday. The land reform issue is even more politically volatile in Bolivia than energy nationalization, which has riled some foreign investors in the country's energy sector but was widely expected among Bolivians. Agrarian reform is a drama that will play out on large swaths of the countryside and could directly affect more than one-fourth of the population.","{'workers', 'control', 'property', 'development', 'poor'}",0.16991513048269888

Reforms related to the reform of state-owned enterprises continued to deepen and the institutional environment for economic and social development improved.

Progress was made in reform of the management system in monopoly industries, with reform plans for telecommunications, power and civil aviation completed and inaugurated. Initial steps were taken to set up a system open to the participation of all sectors to provide credit and financial guarantees, mainly for small and medium enterprises. Establishment of a social security system was accelerated. The basic living allowances of over 90 percent of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises were guaranteed. An overwhelming majority of the retirees of these enterprises received their basic pensions on time and in full, with 97.8 percent of them receiving it from government-directed funds to which their employers are obliged to contribute. The trials to improve the social security system in Liaoning and other provinces proceeded smoothly. Marked progress was made in lifting controls on grain purchase markets and prices in the key grain distribution areas of southeastern coastal regions. A vertical management system for the central grain reserves was set up by and large. The emphasis of work to deregulate cotton purchasing has shifted to efforts to rectify market order and improve quality monitoring. Control over prices for more commodities and services was relaxed and vigorous efforts were made to find new price management methods such as holding public hearings to set prices.

XIN_ENG_19951024.0030,"Chinese President Speaks at U.N.. Our experience and lessons over past half a century, the purposes and principles of the Charter and the epochal theme of peace and development, have all raised solemn and urgent demands on us. We must create a secure and reliable international environment of lasting peace and stability. Peace is the primary necessity of the world's people. Without peace, there can be no development to speak of. Disputes between states should be resolved through peaceful negotiations and consultations instead of resorting to the use or threat of force. The peacekeeping operations of the U.N. should be carried out in strict compliance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and must not be turned into intervention of a disguised form in the internal affairs of member states, still less should peace keepers be drawn into conflict as another warring party. Moreover, the U.N. must live within its means in conducting peacekeeping operations. Efforts should be made to achieve the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction, the reduction of the huge arsenals of a small number of countries, and the control and removal of various factors that might lead to war, with a view to safeguarding the security of all countries and regions in the world. We must uphold the norms governing international relations with the principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs as the core. These principles established by the founders of the United Nations fifty years ago are of greater vitality and realistic significance. All sovereign states, large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. All countries, whether developed or developing, are entitled to participate in international affairs on an equal footing. The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence should serve as the norms for all nations to observe in their mutual relations. As state sovereignty is sacred and inviolable, no counry has this special privilege to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or impose its will upon others. Certain big powers, often under the cover of ""freedom"", ""democracy"" and ""human rights"", set out to encroach upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfere in their internal affairs and undermine their national unity and ethnic harmony. This has become a principal cause for the intranquility in the world today. It is time that we wrote a new chapter in the annals of international relations in which the phenomena of the big bullying the small, the strong lording it over the weak and the rich oppressing the poor are removed completely from the face of the earth. We must establish a new type of international economic relations featuring mutual benefit, mutual complementarity and common development. As countries become increasingly closer in their relations, their economic interdependence and mutual complementarity of relative advantages have grown all the more obvious. No country can afford to stand aloof from the international community and isolate itself from the global market. The internationalization of economic life requires that all countries conduct extensive exchanges and cooperation in the economic, technological, financial, trade and other fields, open up to one another and do away with protectionism and discriminatory trade policies. Prolonged colonial rule and the unjust and irrational international economic order have caused poverty and backwardness in many Third World countries. To fight and eliminate poverty is a major task facing the world today. The developed countries should come to the aid of the developing countries by providing capital, reducing or forgiving debts, transferring technology and conducting trade on equal terms, with a view to revitalizing their economy and improving their people's livelihood. This also serves the long-term interests of the developed countries. The achievement of common economic growth and universal prosperity of all countries is the goal to which the entire mankind should dedicate itself. We should bring about a situation of international harmony which allows making independent choices and seeking common ground while putting aside differences. In this world of ours, there are about 200 countries different from one another in terms of social system, values, development level, history, religion and culture. It is within the sovereignty of every nation to opt, in keeping with its own reality and the will of its people, for a social system and road of development of its own choice. No one else has the right to interfere with it. Every country and every people has its special characteristics and strong points. It is only by respecting one another, seeking common ground while putting aside differences, living with one another in amity and complementing one another can we make the world as colorful as a garden where a hundred flowers are contending in beauty. Without diversity, there can be no world as we know it. Without diversity, there can be no Uinted Nations either. Those who refuse to recognize and respect the diversity of the world and attempt to make it an uniform domain of their rule are sure to run themselves into a stone wall.","{'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'human rights'}",0.1694152335495061

XIN_ENG_20070316.0045,"Full Text: Report on the Work of the Government (5). The social safety net was strengthened. Trials to fully fund personal accounts for basic old-age insurance of enterprise employees were expanded to eight more province-level localities on the basis of the pilot project in the three provinces in northeast China. After years of effort, the work of incorporating basic cost of living allowances for workers laid off from SOEs into the unemployment insurance system has been basically completed. Basic pension benefits for retired enterprise employees were increased. The coverage of the social security system was further expanded, revenue from social security premiums increased, and oversight and management of social security funds was strengthened. The basic framework of a social assistance system for both urban and rural residents was set up, and charity programs continued to grow. The central government spent 13.6 billion yuan on basic cost of living allowances for urban residents, 2.4 billion yuan more than the previous year, and local governments also increased their spending on these allowances to varying degrees. A system of basic cost of living allowances for rural residents was initiated in 2,133 counties, county-level cities and city districts in 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government, benefiting 15.09 million residents. Funding for providing food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses for childless and infirm rural residents now mainly comes from the government budget instead of depending on rural collectives. Assistance for orphans and protection for homeless juveniles were strengthened. Allowances for all types of entitled groups were increased significantly, with an 11.2 billion yuan allocation from the central government budget, a 47% increase from the previous year. We improved the policy for compensating people whose land has been expropriated to build large or medium-sized reservoirs and for assisting people displaced for reservoir projects, benefiting 22.88 million persons. This longstanding problem is now being gradually solved. Last year, some areas in China were hit by natural disasters of a severity seldom seen in history, including typhoons and droughts. We promptly took steps to carry out disaster relief work and rebuild disaster-hit areas. The central government raised some disaster relief allowances and allocated 11.2 billion yuan in relief funds to help disaster victims get back on their feet. 7. We continued to strengthen democracy and the legal system. Democracy at the community level made continued progress. Government-sponsored legislation was further improved. The State Council submitted seven bills to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation, including the Law on Corporate Income Tax (draft), the Antitrust Law (draft), the Law on Response to Emergencies (draft) and the revised Compulsory Education Law (draft), and promulgated 29 sets of administrative regulations, including the Regulations on AIDS Prevention and Control and the Regulations on the Administration of Overseas-Funded Banks. We accelerated development of government by the rule of law and implemented the Administrative Permit Law, the Civil Service Law, and the Program for Advancing All Aspects of Government Administration in Accordance with the Law. Oversight in the form of supervision and auditing was strengthened. Steady progress was made in reform of the judicial administrative system and its working mechanisms. The work of addressing public complaints registered by means of letters and visits was strengthened. In public security, continued improvements were made in the crime prevention and control system and extensive efforts were made to promote peace and security. Significant progress was made in work focused on improving conditions in areas with poor public security and in addressing serious public security issues. An all-out effort was made to build clean government and combat corruption and a campaign to combat bribery in business was launched. A number of major cases involving government offices and their employees were investigated and dealt with, and a number of people guilty of corruption were punished to the full extent of the law. Work related to ethnic groups, religions, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese was further improved. We continued to make progress in modernizing national defense and the army. Significant progress was made in China's diplomatic work.  (More)","{'disasters', 'workers', 'control', 'social security', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.1684048464726392

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces stationed in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and local ethnic groups are so close they feel like family, and are working hard together for the region's stability and prosperity. The PLA forces in Xinjiang have always regarded ethnic solidarity as a key issue in promoting social stability and development and maintaining unity, said local officials. They have strict discipline that requires the soldiers to behave themselves properly in accordance with the customs of local ethnic groups, and teaches the soldiers that all ethnic groups, large or small, depend on each other in order to grow. The troops have assisted local economic development with a lot of manpower and machinery, and helped complete 27 major local construction projects, including the railway artery through southern Xinjiang and the fiber-optic communications cable linking Urumqi to Lanzhou, capital of neighboring Gansu Province. Aid-the-poor groups formed by the soldiers have helped some 130,000 farmers and herdsmen across the region, most of whom have shaken off poverty, while over 100,000 soldiers have been sent to help prevent natural disasters or join in rescue and relief work.","{'disasters', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.16815761777203722

(8). 8. Great success was achieved in fighting devastating natural disasters. When parts of south China were hit with severe snow and ice storms at the beginning of the year, all localities and sectors, in accordance with the unified arrangements made by the central authorities, immediately set emergency response mechanisms in motion, did everything in their power to ensure transport, power supply and people's livelihood, and restored agricultural and industrial production as well as disaster-destroyed infrastructure in a short period of time. In the wake of the massive earthquake that hit Wenchuan, Sichuan Province on May 12, the whole nation was quickly mobilized. Forces of all kinds, including members of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed Police Forces, the militia, reserve forces, and public security personnel, as well as health workers, journalists, scientists and volunteers, responded promptly. Compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and overseas Chinese made generous donations. The international community offered us a helping hand. Together, we achieved a great victory in the fight against the earthquake and wrote a moving, heroic paean memorializing our brave efforts. We pulled 84,000 survivors from the rubble, provided medical treatment to 2.96 million people who were injured or fell ill, and delivered aid to a total of 10.584 million people affected by the earthquake. In order to rebuild the disaster areas more effectively, the Regulations on Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction were formulated. With the approval of the NPC Standing Committee, a recovery and reconstruction fund was set up. The overall plan for recovery and reconstruction and ten specific plans were drawn up in a short period of time. Provinces (or province-level municipalities) were paired up with severely hit counties (or county-level cities), with each province providing assistance to its twin county. All recovery and reconstruction plans are being implemented quickly, and over 8,400 projects have been started already. Lives and production are returning to normal in the disaster-hit regions. Despite drastic changes in the global economic and financial situation and a marked increase in unexpected difficulties at home, notable achievements were made in economic and social development in 2008, and none of them came easily. They would not have been possible without the strong leadership and scientific decision-making of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, close collaboration and hard work of all localities and sectors, or the resolve, unity and painstaking efforts of the people of all ethnic groups. While fully recognizing these achievements, we are keenly aware that the global and domestic economic situations are grim and complex, and that the task of maintaining steady and fairly rapid economic growth has become more formidable. The spread of the international financial crisis has exerted an enormous impact on the global economy, and the breadth, depth and intensity of the impact have exceeded everyone's expectations: the economies of major developed countries might all fall into recession, emerging market economies and developing countries are experiencing slowdowns in growth, and the world economy will experience a long period of stagnation and adjustment. In addition, there has been mounting global deflationary pressure and resurging trade protectionism, which will add more uncertainties and instabilities. The impact of the global financial crisis and many outstanding problems at home have suddenly made it more difficult to keep our economy going strong. We have not yet improved the extensive pattern of development or solved institutional and structural problems, including poor independent innovation capacity, unsuitable industrial structure, imbalance between domestic and external demand, the high toll on natural resources and the environment, the disproportion between investment and consumption, and imbalances between economic and social development, between rural and urban areas, and between different regions. In particular, the slowdown in economic growth has become a significant economic problem since the fourth quarter of last year. First, industrial production declined significantly. The growth of value-added of large industrial enterprises dropped by 9.7, 11.9 and 11.7 percentage points year on year in October, November and December respectively. Demand for energy, raw materials and transport shrank; prices of products such as steel and electrolytic aluminum fell; the problem of excess production capacity became apparent. Second, some consumption hotspots cooled down. The total floor area of commodity housing sold throughout the year decreased by 19.7%. The growth of automobile sales was 15.1 percentage points less than the previous year. Demand for other commodities, consumption of which had grown fast in recent years, also shrank by varying degrees. Third, foreign trade dropped sharply, with exports down by 2.2% and 2.8% year on year in November and December respectively. Fourth, some enterprises faced the difficult situation of fewer orders, sluggish sales and reduced profits. These problems spread from coastal regions to the hinterland, from small- and medium-sized enterprises to large ones, and from export-oriented industries to other industries. Many more enterprises than before suffered losses. Meanwhile, there are also acute problems concerning employment, agriculture, rural areas and farmers, energy conservation and pollution reduction and the financial sector. There has been mounting pressure on employment and reemployment. Enterprises' demand for workers decreased significantly. The number of people joining the urban workforce in October, November and December dropped each month, standing at 840,000, 550,000 and 380,000 respectively. The employment situation for college graduates, urban residents having difficulty finding jobs and rural migrant workers has become worse. There are many factors restraining the growth of agricultural production and farmers' incomes. Agricultural infrastructure remains weak. After five years of bumper harvests in a row, it will be very difficult to keep grain production growing steadily. There is great downward pressure on prices of farm products. The return home of many rural migrant workers and their difficulty in finding steady jobs makes it harder to keep rural residents' incomes growing. It is now more difficult to promote energy conservation and pollution reduction. Energy-conserving technologies and services are developing slowly due to the objective fact that they are still in the early stage of development. Moreover, because enterprises are facing more difficulties and some are not operating at full capacity, they spend less on technological upgrading and pollution reduction, which leads to a drop in their energy efficiency and ineffective operation of their pollution control equipment. Therefore, there will be great pressure to achieve energy conservation and pollution reduction targets in the last two years of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period. Potential risks in financial markets cannot be ignored, and confidence in the capital market urgently needs to be strengthened. There is chaos in the market order of some sectors, and workplace accidents and major food safety incidents repeatedly occur, inflicting heavy losses on people's lives and property. We will take vigorous steps to solve the above problems and minimize their adverse impact.

LTW_ENG_20050909.0038,"Learning from Katrina. The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: Even with the evacuation unfinished and the structural damage unassessed, it is not too early to start talking about how to rebuild New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast. When residents return to their communities, many will want to rebuild everything exactly as it was. That is understandable. But lessons of the past suggest that this is exactly what should not happen. In 1969 Hurricane Camille destroyed coastal homes in Mississippi and Louisiana, wiping out much of the area, including Biloxi. But government policy after Camille -- as with government policy after major East Coast hurricanes -- amounted, in the words of one expert, to an ``urban development program.'' Instead of shrinking, coastal development expanded. In truth, local and federal policies, ranging from beach preservation subsidies to zoning laws, have long encouraged building homes along coasts that are unusually susceptible to flooding and wind. Even the National Flood Insurance Program, set up in 1968 to offer government-subsidized flood insurance to susceptible communities in exchange for strict zoning and construction regulations, is at fault. Over the past two decades, the regulatory force of the law has been substantially weakened. All that is left in many places is the subsidy, which thousands of homeowners collect over and over again. Elsewhere in the country, government programs to acquire property in flood plains have successfully persuaded people to leave them. After the Mississippi River floods of 1993, the town of Valmeyer, Ill., was moved in its entirety, away from the river and onto a surrounding bluff. After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, the city of Kinston, N.C., moved entire neighborhoods out of flood plains and revitalized the city as well. But the political power of wealthy beachfront property owners has prevented such programs from being implemented along the coasts. That must not be allowed to happen again. The case of New Orleans is even more difficult. New Orleans is not Valmeyer, and cannot be easily moved. Nor is it Biloxi, Miss., where stronger building codes and zoning laws designed to move construction away from the shore could make the city better able to withstand hurricanes. The geography of New Orleans will leave the city forever vulnerable to catastrophic flooding. Yet the city's history and culture make it very much worth saving. As a result, the city, joined by state and federal governments, must begin to face several extraordinarily difficult and delicate issues: Should the lower, most susceptible parts of the city be rebuilt? Should other houses be constructed -- as houses in the city were a century ago -- on stilts? Should the swamps and wetlands around the city be at least partially restored? How should compensation and new housing requirements be handled? Considering the government's murky record of looking after the poor following natural disasters (as the aftermath of Hurricane Camille demonstrated), those most affected by government's decisions must be part of the discussion.","{'disasters', 'vulnerable', 'property', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.16143108671279893

A widening income gap in China has been a focus of discussions among members of its top advisory body since its annual session opened on March 2.

They expressed the view in panel discussions on Premier Li Peng's report on China's development plans for the next 15 years. Member Li Hongchang, president of Jilin Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, called on the central government to strengthen macroeconomic controls by law as well as economic and administrative means to put a stop to the trend.

In accordance with the requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, we took big strides in reforming the systems of public finance, taxation, banking, foreign trade, foreign exchange, planning, investment, pricing, circulation, housing and social security. Market forces notably served as the basic means of regulating the allocation of resources, and the framework of a macroeconomic control system was preliminarily established. We pressed forward with the reform in state-owned enterprises after making experiments in selected ones. We further developed the pattern with the public sector remaining dominant and diverse sectors of the economy developing side by side. We continued to expand economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with other countries, effected big increases in foreign trade and in the use of foreign funds and brought about a marked rise in state foreign exchange reserves. We took new steps in promoting cultural and ethical progress. Gratifying achievements were scored in science, technology, education, culture, public health, sports, family planning and other social undertakings. We further improved the publicity work and guidance for public opinion and promoted ideological and ethical progress. Significant progress was made in developing socialist democracy and improving the legal system. A series of laws and regulations commensurate with the development of a socialist market economy were enacted, and law enforcement and the judiciary work were strengthened. The patriotic united front expanded, and the great unity of all our nationalities was further consolidated and developed. Social and political unity and stability provided an important guarantee for the reform and development. Progress was made in modernizing national defense. The combat effectiveness of the army was further enhanced. The people's army made major contributions to defending the national security, safeguarding the unification of the motherland, taking part in national economic development and fulfilling such tasks as dealing with emergencies and disasters and providing relief. The living standards of the people rose notably. The average annual per capita income for living expenses increased by 7.2 percent for city dwellers in real terms, while the average annual per capita net income went up by 5.7 percent for rural residents in real terms, making the period one of those with the biggest increases. The market had an adequate supply of commodities, and the people's living conditions including food, clothing, housing, articles for daily use and transportation improved markedly. Savings deposits of urban and rural residents rose considerably. The rural poor population of the country decreased by 32 million. In the past five years we have done a great deal of work with marked results in the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Chinese government has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is a consolation to numerous revolutionary martyrs and veterans as it has wiped out the century-old humiliation of the Chinese nation.

XIN_ENG_20090302.0346,"Full Text: Fifty Years of Democratic Reform in Tibet (10). -- Abolishing the oppression and exploitation of feudal serfdom system, liberating a million serfs and slaves. After the quelling of the armed rebellion in 1959, the Central People's Government immediately dissolved the Kasha regime and its armed forces, courts and prisons, which had oppressed the Tibetan people for hundreds of years. At the same time, it repealed the old Tibetan Code and barbarous punishments. This was followed by a planned and step-by-step campaign in the rural areas against rebellion, corvee labor and slavery, and for reduction of rent for land and of interest on loans; a campaign launched in the pastoral areas against rebellion, corvee labor and slavery, and helping hired herdsmen and herd owners; a campaign launched in the monasteries against rebellion, feudal privileges and exploitation, and to square accounts with political persecution, hierarchical oppression and economic exploitation; a campaign launched in the urban areas against rebellion, the feudal system, exploitation and privileges, and on reduction of rent for land and of interest on loans. In addition, the democratic reform was conducted in the border areas by stages, abolishing the bondage of the serfs and slaves to their feudal masters, as well as the feudal system, exploitation and privileges, and corvee labor and high-interest loans. The one million serfs and slaves in Tibet were emancipated. They became the masters of their country, as well as Tibet. Their lives and personal freedom are now protected and safeguarded by the Chinese Constitution and law. They no longer suffer from the serf-owners' political oppression, forced labor and inhuman treatment, as well as heavy corvee taxes and usurious exploitation. Nyima Tsering, who was elected the first chairman of the Farmers' Association during the democratic re-form, used to be a serf of Surkhang Wangchen Gelek, a galoin of the Tibet local government. Wangchen Gelek once said, ""Nyima Tsering is my property. I will do whatever I like to him. If I like, I can roll him into a ball and put him in my pocket, or stretch him into a belt and tie it around my waist."" After the democratic reform, Nyima Tsering said, ""Now my personal freedom is protected by the law. I am no longer an-other's private property. How wonderful this is!"" Tsering Lhamo had been a serf for more than 30 years. After the democratic reform, she organized the first Nangsan Mutual Aid Team at Kyerpa Township, in Nedong County, Shannan Prefecture. Later, she held the post of vice chairman of the Standing Committee of People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region. -- Implementing land reform, abolishing the feudal land own- ership, making serfs and slaves masters of the land. On September 21, 1959, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region passed the ""Decision on Abolishing Feudal Land Ownership System and Implementing Farmers' Land Ownership,"" stipulating that farm-land and other means of production originally occupied by those serf-owners involved in the armed rebellion were to be confiscated and distributed to landless serfs and slaves, and the land and other means of production of serf-owners who had not participated in the rebellion were to be redeemed by the state and then distributed to the serfs and slaves. According to statistics, in the democratic reform the central government spent 45 million yuan on the redemption of 900,000 mu of land and over 820,000 heads of livestock from more than 1,300 house-holds of serf-owners and agents who had not participated in the rebel- lion. Over 2.8 million mu of land was confiscated or redeemed from serf-owners, and distributed to 800,000 former serfs or slaves of 200,000 households. Each of the former serfs and slaves got about 3.5 mu of land. The laboring Tibetan people who had been enslaved generation after generation stood on their own land, celebrating all night. They cried, ""The sun of the Dalai Lama shone on the nobility, while the sun of Chairman Mao is shining on our poor people. Now the Dalai Lama's sun is set, and our sun is rising."" Tibet's one million serfs and slaves became masters of the land and other means of production for the first time. Their unprecedented enthusiasm for production and life gave rise to a rapid change in Tibet's social situation and their living conditions. When the land reform was basically completed in 1960, the total grain output for Tibet was 12.6 percent higher than that in 1959 and 17.5 percent higher than in 1958, the year before the land reform. Moreover, the total number of livestock was 10 percent more than in 1959. During the democratic reform, Tibet's first supply and marketing cooperative, first rural credit cooperative, first private primary school, first night school, first literacy class, first film projection team and first modern medical organization were established in its history. By the end of 1959, 28 neighborhood committees had been set up in Lhasa, offering jobs to over 8,700 vagrants and beggars, providing relief to more than 8,500 poor people, and taking in over 120 childless, aged, sick and disabled people. In 1960, Ngachen Hydroelectric Station was completed and put into use, bringing electric lighting for the first time to the citizens of Lhasa. In 1959 and 1960, dozens of small-scale modern factories were set up in Tibet, employing over 20,000 Tibetan workers. Tibet's roads built in those two years totaled 12,500 km, and reached over 90 percent of the counties in the region.

NYT_ENG_20020613.0048,"EDITORIAL: TRAGEDY IN THE NIGERIAN DELTA. The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 13: Conflicts between oil producers and residents of the Niger River delta in Nigeria burst into the world's consciousness in 1995 with the government's execution of an environmental activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa. The disputes are still raging, with residents' groups threatening to attack oil facilities unless the government begins talks on giving the states control of more oil revenues and the oil companies start hiring more local residents. Nigeria's dictatorship was replaced by an elected government three years ago, when Olusegun Obasanjo became president. But so far, civilian rule has not changed the government's habitual use of harsh repression nor dented the delta's overwhelming poverty. Although delta oil brings in more than 80 percent of Nigeria's hard currency, the delta's seven million residents are among the poorest in the nation. Environmental damage from oil extraction has ruined agriculture and fishing, but oil produces few jobs. A new Constitution, written before Obasanjo took office, raises the percentage of oil revenues that go to the delta from 3 percent to 13. But the money has come late, and has not all been paid. The Supreme Court, moreover, recently ruled that offshore oil is federal property, a decision that may force delta states to cut their budgets. Nigeria's government and the delta oil companies say, with some justification, that local residents aggravate matters. Ethnic youth organizations engage in kidnapping and extortion. Local chiefs demand payoffs. Unfortunately, the oil companies have gone along with such payments, buying the allegiance of local leaders rather than winning public support with effective development projects.","{'control', 'poverty', 'property', 'extortion', 'development', 'poor'}",0.15320312472770564

It's a controversial request - one that would affect perhaps 20,000 people who entered this country illegally, are seeking asylum, or are appealing immigration decisions. The proposal is a tough sell politically, but it makes global sense. Pr?val wants Bush to grant Haitian immigrants ""temporary protected status."" It's a legal time-out for immigrants who come from countries facing crises such as armed conflicts and natural disasters. The status already applies to certain Nicaraguan immigrants, who are covered because of devastation caused in 1998 by Hurricane Mitch. Immigrants from El Salvador are covered because of earthquakes there in 2001. To make his own case, Pr?val points to devastating storms that struck Haiti in 2004, causing thousands of deaths, widespread homelessness, and the destruction of fertile land. Pr?val does not say so in his letter, but as Bush knows, Haiti is also chronically racked by poverty, AIDS, violence, and illiteracy. Haitian workers in the United States play a key role in combating those problems. Pr?val points to how much his country relies on money that Haitians earn in the United States and send to relatives at home.

NYT_ENG_20000927.0278,"ECONOMIC SCENE: FEAR OF BIG GOVERNMENT NOT JUSTIFIED BY U.S.. George W. Bush has finally made government the issue of the presidential campaign. After wasting months focusing on Al Gore's character, he returned to what was always the Republicans' meat and potatoes. As president, Gore would give you big government, Bush now emphasizes. But if voters elect him instead, Bush says, he would continue to tame Washington. Bush is picking up, of course, from the legacy of President Reagan, who was determined to bench government as long as he could. Reagan helped make entrepreneurialism and profits respectable again, which was no small achievement. And some deflation of government was no doubt deserved. In the 1960s and '70s, advocates of progressive actions underestimated how difficult such tasks as reducing poverty and revitalizing the inner cities really were, and did not take sufficient care to develop new policies that would be effective. Americans also overestimated the nation's potential affluence. Remember guns and butter? But the oversimplified fear of big government has been damaging and does not accurately reflect American history. On the crucial role of government in the nation's economic success, our past is unambiguous. Beginning with Jefferson's presidency, the federal government may have resisted building a national system of roads, but by the 1820s the states picked up the ball. Led by New York, the states invested millions of dollars, which was big money then, in new canals, and New York even made loans to business. Where would the early economy have been without these canals? In those same years, federal laws were passed to protect the rights to the ownership of property for millions of Americans, including squatters, even though it violated the sanctity of the contracts the nation's rich landowners held. To Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian development specialist and author of ``The Mystery of Capital'' (Basic Books), America's far-seeing protection of property rights was a key to economic success. Before the Civil War, there was a pitched battle over whether primary education should remain private, but public education thankfully prevailed, and America became the best-educated nation in the world. Now, economists believe educational attainment is the foremost economic resource of a nation.","{'entrepreneur', 'property', 'development', 'poverty', 'ownership'}",0.15021241764048815

Cadres at the grass-roots level, teachers and employees in government departments and institutions play an important role in social stability and development. We must ensure  that they are paid on time and in full. This is the duty of governments at all levels and an important way of seeking truth from facts and adhering to the mass line. When preparing budgets, financial departments at all levels must first allocate sufficient  funding to pay the wages of employees in government departments, schools and other institutions as required by the government and put all such funds into special financial accounts for wages in the state treasury. These funds will be used to pay wages to employees and must not be diverted to other purposes to ensure that wages for the current year are paid on time. At the same time, we must step up efforts to unify the way financial departments pay  the wages of personnel in Party and government departments and to turn over responsibility for paying the salaries of teachers in rural primary and secondary schools to financial departments at county level. Second, the proportion of total expenditures for social security in the budget must be increased to ensure that the  basic pensions of retirees from state-owned enterprises and the basic living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises are distributed on time and in full and to support the  reorganization and restructuring of state-owned enterprises and industrial restructuring. Third, we must strive to guarantee funding for developing the national strength, science and technology, education, personnel training, culture and other key fields and projects. Fourth, we must strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the economy and vigorously support development of agricultural infrastructural facilities, establishment of a disaster prevention and control system and projects designed to protect natural forests, restore cultivated land to forests or grassland and prevent and control desertification. We must support efforts to deepen reform of the grain distribution system and rural taxes and fees and step up anti-poverty efforts to truly lighten the financial burden on farmers. To guarantee funding for key projects, we must keep in mind the requirements of public finance, work hard to readjust and  optimize the pattern of expenditures and take further steps to standardize the scope of government funding so that the state no longer has to support so many people and so many projects. In conjunction with the effort to restructure local government departments, we must do a good job in setting the number of departments, the number of positions and the number of employees and strictly control administrative expenses. Government funding should be gradually reduced for institutions that have the capability of entering the market and generate a stable income. Direct government investment in competitive industries should also  be gradually reduced.

North Korea is facing one of its biggest food shortages in the past decade with millions of people going hungry because of a poor harvest and a huge drop in donor aid, a U.N. official said Wednesday. Anthony Banbury, the Asian regional director for the Rome-based World Food Program, who just returned from a six-day trip to North Korea, said officials there told him they faced a food gap of 1 million tons because of a bad harvest last year and a 75 percent fall in donor assistance.

North Korea has relied on foreign food aid since natural disasters and mismanagement devastated its economy in the mid-1990s and led to a famine estimated to have killed some 2 million people. But the secretive regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il restricted activities of aid agencies and pressed them to reduce the size of their foreign staffs in the country. The WFP suspended aid in December 2005 after North Korea claimed food supplies were adequate and asked it to switch focus to economic development. The agency has argued that the change was too abrupt and would leave millions hungry.","{'famine', 'disasters', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.1491669754644957

He said many of these nations, which have relatively high incomes compared to the world's poorest countries, are being pushed to the sidelines by globalization of trade while international financial institutions concentrate on the financial crisis in Asia and Russia's economic difficulties. ``There are new threats to the security of small states from economic shocks, natural disasters, global warming, that make them increasingly vulnerable,'' Arthur said. ``We want (the World Bank and the IMF) to focus on these concerns and they have agreed to do so.'' Arthur led a group of ministers from Lesotho, Mauritius, Fiji and New Zealand that met with World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.The group met Thursday with senior State Department officials. A member of the delegation said Wolfensohn enthusiastically agreed with the objectives of the small states' mission. It was established by the Commonwealth, which groups Britain and 53 of its former colonies, at its summit meeting last October. Small nations that are not members of the Commonwealth also are involved.","{'shocks', 'disasters', 'vulnerable', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.14600474844750963
XIN_ENG_20090302.0350,"Full Text: Fifty Years of Democratic Reform in Tibet (14). -- People's living standards have been greatly enhanced, with their subsistence and development conditions much improved. Before the democratic reform in 1959, Tibetan peasants and herdsmen had barely any means of production. Debt-ridden almost for the whole life, they hardly expected any net income. But since 1978 the per capita net income of Tibetan peasants and herdsmen kept increasing at an average rate of 10.1 percent per year, reaching 3,176 yuan in 2008. The annual growth rate in the 2003-2008 period was 13.1 percent. The per capita disposable income of urban dwellers in Tibet stood at 12,482 yuan in 2008, which was 21 times that of the 565 yuan in 1978. Before the democratic reform, more than 90 percent of Tibet's residents had no private housing, the peasants and herdsmen had very poor living conditions, and the per-capita housing of urban dwellers was less than three sq m. At that time, Lhasa had a population of 20,000 only, and nearly 1,000 were poverty-stricken or beggar households huddling in tattered shelters on the outskirts. Today, with the construction of a new countryside and the comfortable housing project underway, 200,000 households, comprising nearly one million peasants and herdsmen, have moved into modern houses. By 2008, the per-capita housing area was 22.83 sq m in rural areas and 33.00 sq m in urban areas. A social security system has been basically put in place to cover both cities and countryside in Tibet. In 2008, the allowances for each family of the infirm elderly without children, which is guaranteed food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses, was raised to 1,600 yuan. In 2006, Tibet led other farming and pastoral areas in China with a system of basic subsistence allowances which covered all peasants and herdsmen with an income below 800 yuan. Before the peaceful liberation, there was no medical institution in the modern sense in Tibet, except for three small, shabby government-run organizations of Tibetan medicine and a small number of private clinics, with fewer than 100 medical workers altogether. If the nearly 300 Tibetan medical practitioners in the farming and pastoral areas were included, the total number of medical workers would still have fallen below 400 - less than four medical workers for every 10,000 residents. Smallpox, cholera, venereal diseases, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, tetanus and other epidemics were prevalent.","{'workers', 'poverty', 'social security', 'development', 'poor'}",0.1452465695209084

XIN_ENG_20040316.0014,"REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT (Full Text-9). Second, we will promote strategic restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy. Great efforts will be made to develop high- quality, high-yield, cost-effective, eco-friendly and safe agriculture, to improve the quality of agricultural products and enhance their competitiveness. We will carry forward the development of industrial belts for producing competitive agricultural products and promote the industrialization of agriculture. We will energetically develop animal husbandry and prevent and control the spread of the highly pathogenic bird flu and other animal epidemics. We will encourage the development of industries that process agricultural products and other non- agricultural industries in rural areas and expand intra-county economies. We will steadily carry out the process of urbanization. We will improve the employment environment for rural workers in cities, provide them with more and better training and create more jobs for them in various ways. Third, we will press ahead with the reform of rural taxes and administrative charges. All taxes on special agricultural products will be repealed except for tobacco, thus reducing the financial burden on farmers by 4.8 billion yuan annually. Beginning this year, the agricultural tax rate will be reduced by more than 1 percentage point per year on average, and agricultural taxes will be rescinded in five years. The agricultural tax burden on farmers will be reduced by 7 billion yuan this year. The central government will appropriate 39.6 billion yuan this year from its budget for transfer payments to support the reform of rural taxes and administrative charges. We will accelerate reforms of county and township government institutions. Fourth, we will deepen the reform of the grain distribution system. All controls over grain purchase and sales markets will be lifted. The reform of state-owned grain enterprises will be accelerated. Control and regulation of grain markets will be strengthened, and subsidies will be given directly to grain producers. The state will appropriate 10 billion yuan this year from its grain risk fund to directly subsidize these producers in order to stimulate their enthusiasm for grain production. The prices of the means of agricultural production will be better monitored and controlled to protect farmers' interests. Fifth, we will increase investment in agriculture and rural areas. Governments at all levels must invest more in agriculture, rural areas and farmers. This year, the central government will appropriate over 30 billion yuan for this purpose, at least 20% more than last year. Treasury bond funds should be invested mainly in the construction of six categories of small projects for rural areas (water-efficient irrigation, potable water supplies, roads, methane production facilities, hydroelectric plants and pasture enclosure) and in construction of water control projects, in order to improve the living and production conditions of farmers. We will continue to aid the rural poor through development by increasing funding for poverty alleviation in various ways and giving people work in place of relief subsidies. Rural financial services will be improved. To assist rural residents expand production, rural credit cooperatives will extend more micro- credit loans to individual families and groups in rural areas. Sixth, progress in agro-science will be accelerated. We will tackle agro-science problems with greater intensity and increase our ability to make advances in agro-science and hold them in reserve and find applications for them. We will strengthen the system for spreading the application of science and technology in rural areas. We will energetically promote wider application of advanced applied technology that can help increase production and improve productivity. We will expand both the size and scope of subsidies for developing seeds of high-quality crop varieties. ( more)","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.14270226801604613
XIN_ENG_20050314.0374,"Full Text: Report on China's central and local budgets (3). At the same time, it should be noted that around 200 billion  yuan of the surplus was due to special and one-time factors. First, part of the revenue increase for 2004 occurred due to overheated  investment in some industries and price rises. A total of 70 to 80 billion yuan more was collected in the form of VAT than in most  years due to the introduction of the ""production-side VAT"", which  increased in line with the overheated growth of investment and  added value of industry, where the new VAT is mainly collected.  Second, the reform of the export tax rebate mechanism resulted in  the loss of a quarter from the fiscal year of 2004 and reduction  of export tax rebates by 3 percentage points on average, thereby  cutting expenditures by nearly 100 billion yuan in the budget.  Third, nearly 30 billion yuan in additional revenue was generated  when the tax departments cleared up transitional accounts. The revenue in the central budget was 253.771 billion yuan ( including the additional amount used to pay export tax rebates) in excess of the figure projected for 2004. We acted in accordance  with the directive of the Party Central Committee and the State  Council to adopt a scientific outlook on development, with the  Decision of the NPC Standing Committee on Strengthening  Examination and Oversight of the Central Budget and with related  resolutions formulated at the Second Session of the Tenth NPC.  Moreover, since a large part of the surplus was due to special and one-time factors, we deemed it inappropriate to use the surplus to increase regular expenditures. The surplus was therefore mainly  used to clear up payments in arrears and to increase spending to  balance economic and social development. Specifically, the  additional 127.532 billion yuan that was to be spent on export tax rebate payments was used to clear up overdue payments. The 3.57  billion yuan from increased collection of the vehicle purchase tax was used for special purposes as required by relevant regulations. An additional 32.103 billion yuan was spent on education and  science, on tax rebates and general transfer payments for local  authorities and on transfer payments for ethnic minority regions  as required by relevant laws and regulations and by the  regulations governing the system of public finance. Another 15.604 billion yuan was used to support the reform of rural taxes and  administrative charges as well as grain production. A total of 40. 485 billion yuan was spent to pay overdue grain compensation for  returning cultivated land to forests. A further 3.25 billion yuan  was used to pay basic old-age pensions for workers retiring from  state-owned enterprises and fund subsistence allowances for urban  residents. A total of 14.856 billion yuan was paid into the  national social security fund, 3 billion yuan was used for  subsidies to support the closing down or bankruptcy of enterprises, and an additional 13.371 billion yuan was spent to fight disasters and provide relief. In making these arrangements, we looked in all directions to prevent risks and adhered to a scientific outlook on development that requires putting people first and striving for  well-rounded, balanced and sustainable development. We brought  general expenditures under control and supported macroregulation  and balanced economic and social development. The State Council  has reported these arrangements and uses for the surplus in the  central budget to the NPC Standing Committee. The revenue in  excess of the projected figures in local budgets was used by local authorities mainly to alleviate financial difficulties in counties and townships, fund expenses for science, education, culture and  health, support agriculture and clear up overdue debts.

XIN_ENG_20070316.0043,"Full Text: Report on the Work of the Government (4). We put education high on the development agenda. A total of 184 billion yuan was allocated by both central and local governments to fund rural compulsory education, enabling us to pay tuition and miscellaneous fees for the 52 million rural students receiving compulsory education throughout the western region and in some areas in the central region, provide free textbooks to 37.3 million students from poor families and grant living allowances to 7.8 million students staying in dormitories. Of the 410 targeted counties, 317 reached the goals of making nine-year compulsory education generally available and basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged adults. The proportion of the target population attaining these two goals in the western region increased to 96% from the 77% of 2003. The central government spent 9 billion yuan over the past three years building facilities for 7,651 rural boarding schools. Eight billion yuan was spent to develop modern primary and middle school distance education f or rural areas. The project covers over 80% of the rural primary and middle schools in the central and western regions and enables over 100 million students to have access to high-quality education resources. New enrollment at secondary vocational schools totaled 7.41 million and total attendance reached 18.09 million. Total attendance at institutions of higher education reached 25 million and the gross enrollment ratio rose to 22%. We worked to strengthen medical and health care services. Work to set up a disease prevention and control system with a wide range of functions that covers both urban and rural areas and a medical treatment system for public health emergencies has been basically completed. Work was begun to set up a rural health service system, and 2.7 billion yuan from the sale of treasury bonds was allocated by the central government for the development of medical and health care facilities at the county, township and village levels. Trials of a new type of rural cooperative medical care system were extended to 1,451 counties, county-level cities and city districts, covering 50.7% of the country's total number of counties, county-level cities and city districts and 410 million rural residents. With 4.27 billion yuan allocated by the central government and additional local government funding, we raised the allowances for rural participants in the cooperative medical care system significantly. Development of the community- based system of urban medical services was accelerated. Subsidized medical care was improved for urban and rural residents. The central government allocated 5.1 billion yuan to support local government efforts to improve public health care services. Substantial progress was made in preventing and controlling major diseases such as AIDS. We energetically developed culture and sports. The press and publishing, radio, television, film, literature and art, philosophy and the social sciences flourished. Culture-related facilities, especially in rural areas, were improved. The project to expand radio and television coverage in rural areas was extended from incorporated villages to unincorporated villages. Continued progress was made in the project to build multi-use cultural centers in communities, towns and townships and the national shared database project for cultural information and resources. Reform of the cultural management system was deepened. Development of the culture industry was accelerated, and cultural exchanges with other countries were increased. Sports activities for the general public were extensively developed, and the level of competitive sports continued to improve. Efforts to promote socialist cultural and ethical progress were strengthened. 6. We worked hard to increase employment and improve social security work. We continued to improve and implement policies on employment and reemployment, and the central government allocated 23.4 billion yuan for employment and reemployment efforts. We created jobs through a variety of channels, stepped up vocational and technical training, provided support and assistance to zero- employment households and people who have difficulty finding employment, and helped 5.05 million laid-off workers find new jobs. The goal set out in 2004 to basically solve the longstanding problems of defaults on payment to construction companies and unpaid wages for rural migrant workers in the construction industry within three years was basically met. A total of 183.4 billion yuan has been paid to construction companies, paying off 98.6% of the total amount owed to them. This payment included 33 billion yuan in overdue wages for rural migrant workers.  (More)","{'workers', 'control', 'social security', 'development', 'poor'}",0.14171246554136155

APW_ENG_19980127.1721,"None. the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent. And the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress. Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years. My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts, targeted to the needs of working families. For education. For child care. For the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test. Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit. Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first. Thank you. Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that's every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. Let us say _ let us say to all Americans watching tonight _ whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system _ Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment. Social Security first. Let's do that _ together. I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion. In facing these issues squarely. In forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country. And I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold the White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: A Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. Thank you. In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage. The information age is first and foremost and information age in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a ten-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door. Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people, have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation. Expanding public school choice. Opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools. Working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway. Committing to expand Head Start to a million children. Launching America Reads. Sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read. Last year, I proposed and you passed 220,00 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit _ a Hope scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that and you should be very proud of it. And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up _ their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up _ he can go on to college. Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And my friends, that will change the face and future of America. Thank you. We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well. By raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics. And every parent already knows the key _ good teachers and small classes. Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My _ thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who pass the state competency test. Now, with these teachers _ listen, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America. Now, if I got the math right, more teachers, teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools. Thank you. We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools. Last year _ last year in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion, and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up. I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn and we will give you the tools to make sure they do. I also asked this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college. Thank you. As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last five years we have led the way in opening new markets with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, Made in the USA. Today, record-high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world. Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears. First, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business. And second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them. This year, I will send legislation to Congress and ask other nations to join us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all _ abusive child labor. Thank you. We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more and more quickly to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason. You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes. Thank you. Thank you. Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for workers _ a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures. Now, we all know in every way in life, change is not always easy. But we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs. So this year, we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support. I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every president has had for two decades. You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond. Now why should Americans be concerned about this? First, these countries are our customers. If they sink in a recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors. So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods which makes it a lot tougher four our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security. The American economy remains sound and strong and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world. Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself. But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund. Thank you. And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead. A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Last year after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal _ two full years ahead of schedule. This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope. For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off welfare. Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up. We still have a lot more to do _ all of us _ to make welfare reform a success. Providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year. We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children. This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this. You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. Thank you. Thank you. Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless. Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face _ an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress _ let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children. Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives. In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993. Since then about 15 million people have taken advantage of it _ and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor. Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts _ America's first lady. Thank you. Thank you. From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable. So here's my plan. Help families to pay for child care for a million more children. Scholarships and background checks for child care workers and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees, and a larger child care tax credit for working families. Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax. You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity? We don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love. A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention, with crime fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road. I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down. Robbery is down. Assault is down. Burglary is down. For five years in a row, all across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets. And again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it. Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders. Thank you. Police, prosecutors and prevention programs _ good as they are _ they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: ``Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.'' I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down. We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it. Today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not. Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies. By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century. Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. Thank you. Thank you. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation. The progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, ``This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory.'' I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight, Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent. Please stand up. In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy. I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them. I'm pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff _ Generals John Shaliskasvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe _ have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year. Thank you. Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world. And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before. We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again. Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace. Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. Thank you. More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part. Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union. To all of you, I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community. First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear _ a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year. But _ at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs _ the high cost of media advertising. For the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates to observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the federal payroll by 300,000 workers; cut 16,000 pages of regulation; eliminated hundreds of programs; and improved the operations of virtually every government agency. But we can do more. Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there. New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers. Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate _ Follow the House. Pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on so I'll be out of trouble. A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, clean-up of polluted sites for development. Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas. We should _ thank you. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing. Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here. Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future. Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit. Last year, we put in place the toughest ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children. Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella. Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children. Thank you. Thank you. Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt or climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk. This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency. We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation. And our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again. Thank you. Thank you. Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard round the world: That we're all created equal. Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived up to it. Often, it is easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong. What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation _ what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer cannot be to dwell in our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities. I have launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is unAmerican. We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask you help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait. Thank you. We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans _ without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation. We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens _ including every one of you at home watching tonight _ is also committed to this cause. We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many. We must be one. Thank you. In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public/private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future. Now, think about this _ the entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene that caused Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime. Soon, we will be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century. Tonight as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute. We have already discovered... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases. As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings. We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace. Think of this _ the first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web _ literally, just a handful of people. Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day. We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. But we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For one thing, I asked Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know? And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today. Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space. Throughout all history, human kindness had only one place to call home _ our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens. The international space station, with its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn. John, you will carry with you America's hopes. And on your uniform once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future. Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag _ its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle _ moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope _ the words that became our national anthem. Today, that star spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures and we must also save them for the ages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America. An America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation. To widen the circle of opportunity. To deepen the meaning of our freedom. To form that more perfect union. Let that be our gift to the 21st century. God bless you and God bless the United States.

Three all-star concerts were given on Saturday for www.netaid.org, a Web site intended to take on not just one cause on one occasion but long-term work on five major global issues: poverty, the environment, human rights, refugees and poor countries' debt. It was a way for stars to demonstrate concern about everything from malnutrition in Bolivia to toxic oil-refinery waste in Lake Charles, La. Net Aid was modeled on Live Aid, the shows in England and the United States that raised $200 million for African famine relief in 1985.

XIN_ENG_20040329.0171,"Africa loses some 500 million dollars by technology transfer due to
migration. Africa is losing annually an amount of some 500 million US dollars by reverse technology transfer due to the increasing of migration from the continent, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said here Monday. The continuing migration of highly skilled and trained Africans has left many Africans countries with insufficient human resources either to sustain economic development and growth or to rebuild communities and societies in post-conflict conditions, said Ndioro Ndiaye, deputy director general of the IOM at a two-day experts group meeting on policy framework on migration in Africa. According to Ndiaye, the problem is likely to get worse as demand for skilled workers in developed countries is likely to increase over the coming years. She said that in Africa, about 13 million refugees and asylum seekers, 21.8 million internally displaced persons and 20 million labor migrants are estimated to live on the continent, which constitute for one fifth of the global total. The prevalence of conflicts, human rights violations, lack of democracy and strong democratic institutions, natural disasters, are among others which the director mentioned as a problem to the migration of African citizens.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'development', 'human rights', 'natural disaster'}",0.13606513334016468
XIN_ENG_20070318.0029,"Full Text: Report on China's central and local budgets (5). First, we supported employment and reemployment work and development of the social safety net. Government spending in the country for employment and the social safety net in 2006 was 433.765 billion yuan, up 17.3% compared to the figure for 2005, representing 109.1% of the budgeted figure. Allocations from the central budget totaled 201.002 billion yuan, an increase of 22.9%. On the basis of the trials in the three northeastern provinces to fully fund individual retirement accounts for the basic pensions of workers retiring from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the trial was extended to eight more provincial-level localities. We worked to ensure appropriate linkage between the urban minimum cost of living allowance system and employment and reemployment policies. We strongly supported the development of a rural medical assistance system in the central and western regions, the pilot program to provide medical assistance to urban residents in poor areas and the work of providing food, clothing, medical care, housing, and burial expenses for childless and infirm rural residents. We conscientiously carried out a strong employment policy and improved implementation measures to help SOEs in financial straits find appropriate solutions to their longstanding problems. We worked hard to assist in solving the problems of demobilized military personnel, including those working in enterprises as cadres, to help them adjust to civilian life. It is particularly worth noting that the central government promptly appropriated relief funds amounting to 11.2 billion yuan to vigorously support relief efforts in response to serious natural disasters, complemented by funds from local governments. Second, we supported the development of education. Government spending on education in 2006 totaled 475.27 billion yuan, up 19.6% compared to the figure for 2005, representing 103.8% of the budgeted figure. The central government's contribution to this amount was 53.6 billion yuan, a year-on-year rise of 39.4%. In addition to giving priority to rural compulsory education, we also launched an initiative to build national vocational colleges as a showcase for vocational higher education and to support the efforts to build hands-on training centers for these colleges. We continued to support the implementation of the May 1998 Project to improve the quality of education in universities. We improved the system of financial assistance policies consisting of government student loans, grants and scholarships as the main forms of aid for students of colleges and secondary vocational schools from financially strapped families to help them complete their education. Third, we supported the development of public health. Budget allocations from governments at all levels for medical care and public health in 2006 reached 131.158 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 26.5%, or 110.7% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, 13.8 billion yuan was from the central budget, up 65.4%. The increased spending was mainly used to finance public health programs such as prevention and control of major communicable and endemic diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and snail fever, to help pay the medical bills of poor women having babies in hospital, to equip and staff community health centers and rural health clinics and to fund the placement of a large number of doctors to rural areas to help develop local healthcare systems. Fourth, we supported innovation in science and technology. In 2006 we set up a system for ensuring stable growth of government funding for science and technology, and central and local governments spent 126.038 billion yuan on science and technology, a year-on-year rise of 26.2%, or 110.2% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, allocations from the central budget totaled 77.4 billion yuan, up 29.2%. We further improved the structure of this funding by increasing spending on basic research, on applied research, and for nonprofit research institutes. We encouraged independent innovation in enterprises by creating a system of incentives and by adopting preferential fiscal and tax policies toward innovative enterprises such as granting tax breaks and awarding government procurement contracts. Fifth, we supported the development of public cultural programs as well as the culture industry. Expenditures of governments at all levels on culture, sports and radio in 2006 amounted to 83.453 billion yuan, 18.6% more than the previous year, or 108.5% of the budgeted figure. Of this amount, allocations from the central government totaled 12.3 billion yuan, up 23.9%. These expenditures were mainly used to proceed with the reform of the cultural management system and also improve the system of public cultural services. The focus of this spending was on funding efforts to extend radio and TV coverage to every village, to bring digital film projection to the countryside, to share cultural information across the country, to reward and assist some rural families that observe the family planning policy and to carry out the ""fewer children equals faster prosperity"" project in the western region.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'control', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.13532274275447817
XIN_ENG_19980528.0249,"China Issues White Paper on Marine Development (10). To protect the ecological environment of fishing grounds, the Water Quality Standards of Fishing Grounds have been drawn up by the Chinese government and the Regulations on the Supervision and Control of the Environmental Sanitation of Shellfish-Raising Areas and other regulations have been drawn up by departments concerned. In addition, a sequence of measures have been taken to further strengthen the eco-environmental protection of spawning grounds of saltwater fish and shrimps, feeding grounds, wintering grounds, migration channels and aquatic farms. A multilevel setup for the protection of the fisheries environment has been established by the state and coastal region authorities, including 15 monitoring stations at and above the provincial level around the country and a number of marine life protected areas in major fishing grounds. In 1995 the department concerned worked out the Procedures for the Administration of Marine Reserves, based on the guiding principle of "" conservation first, appropriate exploitation and sustainable development,"" and divided each marine nature reserve into core, buffer and experimental zones, in order to improve the building and management of the marine nature reserves. At present 59 marine protected areas, covering gulfs, islands, estuaries, coasts, coral reefs, mangrove swamps, coastal lagoons, marine natural history sites, seaweed beds and wetlands, have been built, covering a total area of 12,900 sq km. China is one of the countries which are most vulnerable to marine calamities. The economic losses suffered by the coastal areas from storms, tidal waves, ice floes, seaquakes, coastal erosion, typhoons, fog and red tides account for about 10 percent of the total of all natural disasters afflicting China. After making unremitting efforts for decades, China has installed a basic marine environment and disaster observation network and forecast-alarm system, covering both offshore areas and distant waters, with the cooperation of several departments. This network engages in analysis, forecast and grading of major marine calamities, and runs maritime rescue centers and coastal emergency stations. As a result, a marine disaster alleviation framework has been put in place. The rapid economic growth and steady population increase in the coastal areas, coupled with the constant expansion of marine exploitation, mean that China continues to face problems of marine environmental protection and disaster alleviation. To cope with this situation, China has adopted the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and Long-Term Program to the Year 2010 for National Marine Environmental Protection, which further advances the three major policies of ""putting prevention first, combining prevention with control,"" ""making the causer of pollution responsible for treating it"" and ""improving the control of the environment."" The following are the principal measures China will take to protect the marine environment:","{'disasters', 'control', 'vulnerable', 'development', 'natural disaster'}",0.13465049409312807

Currently nearly half of the continent's population goes to bed hungry. Recent statistics indicate that 80 percent of the continent's population lives on a daily income of 2 US dollars and nearly half struggles to survive on 1 dollar a day or less. The hunger and poverty the continents is facing interact to fuel a downward spiral that limits people's ability to grow or purchase food. The inappropriate social and economic policies, natural disasters and civil conflicts have contributed greatly to the continent's food insecurity.

XIN_ENG_20040316.0390,"Report on China's central and local budgets (full text-2). Total central government revenue in 2003 exceeded the projected figure by 52.4 billion yuan (after allowing for an additional 82.9 billion yuan used in export tax rebates during the implementation of the budget). This surplus included 7.8 billion yuan from increased vehicle purchase tax, which was incorporated into the calculation of revenue and expenditures in the central budget and was funded for special purposes according to the relevant regulations. Another 7.8 billion yuan was used to increase tax rebates and general transfer payments to local governments in accordance with the relevant institutional rules. The final 36.8 billion yuan was used during the year mainly for combating disasters and providing disaster relief, developing education, health, and science and technology, supporting enterprise reforms, improving social security, and upgrading the ecological environment. The State Council has reported all this to the NPC Standing Committee. The revenue in excess of the projected figures in local budgets was used by local authorities mainly to increase expenditures for education, science and technology, culture and health and to pay overdue wages and salaries. 2. Finance played a greater role in macro-control and in safeguarding the economy. The government continued to follow the proactive fiscal policy to promote sustained and rapid growth of the national economy. Treasury bonds issued to finance projects totaled 140 billion yuan. While exercising strict management over these funds, we improved the orientation and structure of their use by giving preference to rural areas, economic restructuring, the central and western regions, science and technology, education, improvement of the ecological environment and public health services. Transfer payments were increased to promote balanced development among different regions. General transfer payments from the central budget to local governments in 2003 totaled 191.2 billion yuan, 17. 9% more than the previous year. Special transfer payments earmarked for social security, agriculture, science and technology, education, health and poverty alleviation amounted to 257.7 billion yuan, up 7.3% year-on-year. In response to the State Council's directive to improve fiscal systems at and below the provincial level, local governments continued to strengthen the abilities of primary-level financial authorities to provide adequate financial resources. To appropriately increase the incomes of employees in government departments and institutions, we steadily implemented the policy of adjusting the wages and salaries of their employees and the pensions of their retirees. The central authorities showed great concern for people's lives and enterprises' production and operations following the outbreak of SARS. First, 2 billion yuan was appropriated from the central budget to set up the Anti-SARS Fund, and a policy was clearly stipulated to provide free SARS treatment for rural and impoverished urban patients. This played a vital role in effectively curbing the spread of the outbreak, particularly to the countryside. Financial authorities at all levels allocated a total of 13.6 billion yuan for SARS prevention and treatment, including 2.8 billion yuan from the central budget. The central government appropriated an additional 1 billion yuan to improve the public health system in the second half of the year. Second, we promptly introduced a range of preferential fiscal and tax policies to aid industries hard hit by the SARS outbreak, such as tourism, food and beverage service, civil aviation, railways, hotels and taxis, so that they could tide over difficulties to resume normal operations as soon as possible. Although the above- mentioned measures increased expenditures and reduced revenue, they protected the health of the people, ensured the normal operations of enterprises and promoted economic and social development. 3.

We will consolidate and strengthen all fiscal and taxation policies designed to support and help agriculture, rural areas and farmers. We are continuing to make support for agriculture, rural areas and farmers the focus of our budgetary arrangements and fiscal work. Particular attention will be given to strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy, promoting its development, increasing rural incomes and making real progress in developing a new socialist countryside. Expenditures in the central budget for agriculture, rural areas and farmers total 562.5 billion yuan, an increase of 130.7 billion yuan or 30.3%. We will increase subsidies for farmers. Expenditures in the central budget for subsidies to farmers total 133.59 billion yuan, an increase of 25.3 billion yuan or 23.4%. Included in this figure is 15.1 billion yuan in direct subsidies to grain producers, 48.2 billion yuan in general direct subsidies for agricultural supplies, 4 billion yuan in subsidies for the purchase of agricultural equipment and machinery, 7.07 billion yuan in subsidies for superior seed varieties, and 1.6 billion yuan in subsidies for training farmers. We will strongly support the development of agricultural production. Expenditures in the central budget for the support of agricultural production total 304.45 billion yuan (including most of the expenditures for agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, expenditures for farmland reforestation projects that are listed in the environmental protection section of the budget, and subsidies for reform of rural taxes and fees that are listed in the section of the budget dealing with fiscal transfer payments from the central to local governments), an increase of 44.19 billion yuan or 17%. This figure includes: 102.28 billion yuan to develop rural infrastructure; 8.4 billion yuan to finance the building of small farm water conservancy facilities and repair small reservoirs in poor condition; 12.72 billion yuan to finance overall agricultural development, which will focus on supporting efforts to improve low- and medium- yield farmland in major grain-producing regions and reduce water use in medium- sized irrigated areas in order to enhance overall agricultural production capacity; 16.5 billion yuan to stabilize and improve the reward policies for major grain-producing counties; 13.5 billion yuan to improve the follow-up policies on farmland reforestation, continue paying subsidies to farmers displaced by farmland reforestation and strengthen the development of basic subsistence farmland for them; 6.05 billion yuan to improve the system of subsidies for agricultural insurance premiums; and 16.73 billion yuan to increase funding to alleviate poverty through development and make innovations in poverty relief mechanisms. We will increase support for wider application of advanced and appropriate agricultural technologies. In addition, we will improve fiscal and taxation policies and measures to stimulate greater production of pork, dairy products and oilseeds. We will set a floor price for the purchase of grain and appropriately increase the floor price for the purchase of grain and wheat when needed. We will accelerate development of rural social programs. The central government has allocated 124.52 billion yuan for this purpose, an increase of 61.14 billion yuan or 96.5%. This sum is made up of: 107.32 billion yuan to support rural education, culture and public health; 9 billion yuan to fully set up and optimize a system of cost of living allowances for rural residents; and 6.2 billion yuan to help people affected by natural disasters to restore their lives.","{'disasters', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.13054562958673366

Members of the House Homeland Security Committee want to know why the Bush administration plans to cut grants to state and local emergency workers, firefighters, disaster training for hospital workers and upgrades to communication systems.

APW_ENG_19960208.0245,"None. Royalty, couturiers, celebrities and development experts have joined hands to put glitz and glamor in fashion from Bangladesh as a way for the country to combat famine and abject poverty. Queen Sophia of Spain and Brazil's First Lady Ruth Cardoso were among nearly 2,000 people who applauded UNESCO's Bangladesh weavers' demonstration and fashion show Wednesday night. A fabric display will continue for a week at the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. ``UNESCO is not planning to get into the fashion business,'' said the organization's general director, Federico Mayor. ``But we want to open the window of Paris on the weavers of Bangladesh.'' The clothes were bright, ethnic and contemporary, and ranged from traditional checked cottons based on what Bangladeshi wear, with tunics and bare-midriff skirts - to silks fit for royalty. Most outfits - for both men and women - were designed by a lissome former model and London fashion student from Bangladesh, Bibi Russell. ``This should be the beginning of cooperative worldwide efforts between creators and artisans to create a world free from poverty,'' she said. The show closed with a rollicking folkoric dance onstage with young Bangladesh student-models and Mayor and others dancing to the compelling rhythms. Actress Marisa Berenson, special ambassador to UNESCO, swung about with the young Bangladeshis, who had just flown in from their country east of India. Queen Sophia told Rosette Mett, owner-designer of the house of Torrente, that she'd soon be wearing one of Torrente's blue and cream safari skirt suits, a product of the Bangladesh weavers shown at UNESCO's parade. Nearly 8,000 weavers are now producing again with backing from Grameen Bank, founded 20 years ago by Muhammad Yunus. Grameen means ``rural'' in Bengali. The weaving cooperative project was founded in 1991. From abject poverty, the poorest of the poor are working their way back to dignity. Looms in Bangladesh are clacking, and the country is producing fabric for fashions, their own native style or haute couture, guided by experts like Russell, who designs and supervises quality control. High fashion is applauding the effort. One fan is Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, a French designer who passionately loves ethnic creativity and natural materials. ``You might call me a Don Quixote,'' he said during the fashion show. ``But I'm interested in couture of the whole world, whether the fabrics come from Fez, Morocco, or Limoges, France, or Dacca, Bangladesh. Fashion is a way to seek spirituality and peace.'' The ecologically-oriented designer also finds this symbiosis of cultures a ``kind of sign language,'' and says he wants to go on working with Bangladeshis, as he has for several years. ``I'd like to promote their fabric with others. These things must be an interchange,'' he said. Yunus _ who studied at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and was a professor at the University of Chittagong _ aims to help the most impoverished of his compatriots by furnishing raw materials, without demanding collateral. He recommended seed money to sponsor cottage industries, usually depending on women, and eventually hit on the idea of reviving the weaving industry. By last year, Grameen Bank had 1,052 branches. It had disbursed loans of over dlrs 1.5 billion, had savings in a group fund of dlrs 107 million and financed the building of 326,754 houses with loans. For textile weaving Yunus got help from Russel, who studied fashion in England, married an Englishman and became a model but finally returned to Bangladesh with a mission to help her people revive artisan and creative pursuits. She started designing fabric patterns, then clothes, to promote Bangladeshi fabrics. ``I want to show the beautiful things we have,'' said Bibi Russell after the fashion show. She uses only natural substances for her styles, including jewelry and accessories of wood, straw and shells. At the weaving demonstration, two Bangladeshis on their first trip abroad clacked away at their looms. Their beautiful luminous plaids in soft cotton fabrics were displayed around the hall. ``We're aiming for a 1996 target of 10 million metres (yards) of our high-quality fabrics, and will be putting 15,000 weavers to work,'' said Yunus. slot v0153/tw","{'famine', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.12290048683226415

A 2002 report by researchers of Harvard University pointed out that America's pervasive legacy of slavery, racism, and substandard, segregated health care for many of the nation's minorities has left a deep chasm between the health status of most minorities and whites. Blacks have enjoyed much poorer medical treatment than whites ever since they came to America from Africa. African Americans have much higher rates of heart diseases, diabetes, AIDS and some cancers. Blacks have a cancer death rate about 35 percent higher than that of whites, the AIDS cases among black women and children are 75 percent higher than among white people, and African-American children also have much higher rates of asthma and juvenile diabetes than white children.

LTW_ENG_20071004.0005,"Fixing the Smithsonian: America's Attic Is Rotting. The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post: Any responsible property owner faced with a leaky roof or faulty wiring would figure out some way to undertake the repairs. Not so the caretakers of the nation's treasures at the Smithsonian Institution. Their failure to come up with a viable plan for the upkeep of Smithsonian facilities has resulted in a $2.5 billion backlog of needed repairs. Not only has this caused public access restrictions, but precious collections also are imperiled. A frightening picture of the crumbling facilities emerges from a recent report by the Government Accountability Office. A lack of temperature controls at the Air and Space Museum caused corrosion of historic airplanes; inadequate fire protection systems at the National Zoo placed animals at risk. Recurring roof leaks have shut down exhibits as workers scramble to protect artifacts. Since the last GAO report in 2005, there have been improvements, but sadly they have been overshadowed by intractable, long-term problems. Estimates for facilities projects through 2013 increased from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion, and no good funding plan exists. Maintenance is always an easy item to defer. For years, Congress failed to provide adequate funding while still demanding an expansion of programs and facilities. Nevertheless, the institution's Board of Regents is ultimately responsible, and it was wrong to insist that under the unique public-private partnership that constitutes the Smithsonian, facilities repairs and upgrades were to be paid for solely with federal, not private, dollars. To make matters worse, the board refused to seriously consider raising private money for the work. It's unrealistic to expect Congress to make $2.5 billion available now, and such a request would be unseemly given the board's poor stewardship of the institution. That the Smithsonian could come up with money to patch the roof of the private home of its former secretary but not to plug a leak in its public art galleries is simply indefensible. The GAO rightly characterizes the Smithsonian as being at a crossroads and urges that a workable financing strategy be developed in partnership with Congress. There are encouraging signs of progress from the regents, who have created a standing committee to deal with the facilities issue and are actively working on private fund-raising initiatives -- some of which were scorned in the past. Part of that disinterest derived from a belief that people don't give money to fix roofs or rewire rooms. Perhaps so, but no one should underestimate Americans' interest, or generosity, in saving their country's treasures.","{'protection systems', 'workers', 'control', 'property', 'poor'}",0.11687962545798555

Confronted with the expectation that the world's population will grow by at least 2 billion people in the next two decades and the reality that demands for basic foods are already outstripping supply, international experts will meet in Switzerland on Thursday to discuss urgently needed advances in agricultural technology. ``Unless there is a major investment in transforming technology, we are in for very severe problems,'' said Ismail Serageldin, the World Bank's vice president for environmentally sustainable development and the chairman of its Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, which called the meeting. According to the World Bank, 700 million of the world's 5.6 billion people now face endemic hunger not caused by natural disasters, which in most years add millions more to the numbers of underfed and undernourished people. Most of the perennially hungry are in India and sub-Saharan Africa, Serageldin said. Although there have been large increases in crop yields over the last 25 years for many basic grain, root, fruit and legume crops, scientists have found that the per-capita output of food has leveled off or dropped in some critical regions of Africa and Asia, where the population growth is fastest. Countries with already unhealthy balance-of-payment gaps are having to import more food. Land has been degraded in many areas, often because of inefficient or poorly maintained irrigation systems. Nearly three-quarters of the world's fresh water now flows into irrigation, Serageldin said.","{'disasters', 'hunger', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.11641777811883833

As global temperatures continue to climb, every continent in the world is vulnerable to severe shifts in weather patterns and rising sea levels that could lead to drought, food shortages, heat waves and disease, according to a report adopted Friday by an international body of scientists. ""No one of us will escape the impacts of climate change,"" said Patricia Romero Lankao, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, speaking from Brussels, where the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is meeting. Four decades of research from scientists around the world shows that the poorest societies in the arid regions of the world -- the areas that have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions -- are likely to be hardest hit. They lack the means to deal with water shortages from droughts and other natural disasters, she said. But the wealthiest nations won't be spared. People in cities will suffer from heat waves, flooding and other catastrophes brought about by disruption in climate patterns, said Romero Lankao, who contributed to the report. The severity of the effects depends on how well nations control carbon dioxide and other gases being released to the atmosphere through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and the clearing of forests.","{'disasters', 'control', 'vulnerable', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.11489669866070432
NYT_ENG_19990221.0159,"EDITORIAL: RISKY BUSINESS IN BELARUS. The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 22: Stepan Simonuk is a farmer in Belarus who recently bought some pigs from a state-owned farm. But he made the mistake of paying cash _ a crime in Belarus, which requires those doing business with a state farm to pay by taking out a loan from the state bank. Now Simonuk has been fined 4.5 billion Belarussian rubles _ about $45,000 at the official exchange rate. Since he cannot pay, he is about to lose his 108-acre farm. Simonuk's story is one of those told by the Belarussian filmmaker Leonid Mindlin in a new documentary, ``Fear,'' about how Belarus' neo-Stalinist dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, keeps control. Lukashenko, who makes no secret of his admiration for Stalin, does not merely persecute independent politicians, journalists and human rights activists. He also crushes entrepreneurs like Simonuk, who are Belarus' only hope for escaping poverty. Thousands of Belarussians have run afoul of a web of arbitrary, obscure and sometimes retroactive decrees and laws regulating taxes, exchange rates and other aspects of business. Many are in jail. Lukashenko has kept 85 percent of Belarus' industry and 90 percent of its agriculture in state hands, which has allowed him to reward loyalists and direct much of the profits to an off-budget fund he controls himself. The network of laws on business also provides him with a handy club against critics or independent thinkers, especially those who have money. Several dozen well-known independent politicians are now charged with business-related crimes. Vasily Staravoitov, a leading critic of government-controlled agriculture, is on trial for alleged embezzlement of state property. Some of the other victims of these laws were members of Belarus' freely elected parliament, which Lukashenko disbanded in 1996.","{'control', 'entrepreneur', 'property', 'poverty', 'human rights'}",0.11290317822942507

LTW_ENG_20050603.0019,"Darfur's Real Problem. The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: Sudan may be extremely poor, but its spin doctors are sophisticated. The suffering in Darfur is terrible, they say, but don't blame the government. The violence is a function of generalized anarchy, which is a function of underdevelopment, which is a function of the West's failure to help: To chastise Sudan's impoverished rulers is therefore hypocritical. Rather than urging punitive sanctions, outsiders such as The Post should urge engagement and assistance. So how do the spin doctors explain this week's news? On Monday Sudan's government showed its real feelings about Western help by bringing charges against the Sudan director of Doctors Without Borders, an intrepid medical charity that runs clinics in Darfur. The next day it detained the charity's Darfur coordinator. Over the past six months, the government has arrested or threatened more than 20 foreign aid workers in Darfur -- not exactly evidence of an appetite for Western engagement. The idea that Darfur's crisis is not really the government's fault has never fit the facts. In response to a rebellion by two local armed groups, Sudan's government attacked civilians with helicopter gunships and armed a local militia to raze villages. Then, far from soliciting international help to deal with the humanitarian fallout, Sudan's government actually blocked aid groups' access to Darfur. Its policy toward displaced people was to deprive them of food, sanitation and protection: in other words, to kill them. Recently, government troops and their militia allies have engaged in a systematic policy of raping civilians. Doctors Without Borders has been targeted this week because it documented these offenses. The harassment of aid workers poses an immediate risk to Darfur's 2 million or so displaced people, who have been unable to plant food and so remain dependent on Western assistance for the near term. But it also poses a challenge for outsiders. Western diplomacy toward Sudan has oscillated between the pressure that we and others advocate and the engagement that implicitly endorses the government's claim that Darfur's suffering reflects anarchy and poverty. Sometimes the United States has persuaded its allies to threaten to bring U.N. sanctions against Sudan. But at other times outside nations have treated the government as a partner that's constructively bringing the violence under control; they've pledged large amounts of aid to support the tentative North-South peace deal on the theory that this will help solve the Darfur crisis. Sometimes, in other words, the world has treated Sudan's government as though it were the cause of Darfur's suffering. And sometimes it has acted as though it might be the solution.","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.10162850581219321

LTW_ENG_20090218.0057,"Chavez's Staying Power. Venezuela just took a democratic step closer to dictatorship. On Sunday, President Hugo Chavez won the right to seek re-election ad infinitum, prevailing in a referendum that eliminated term limits for the presidency and other elected offices. Although the balloting was deemed valid by opposition leaders, who have said they will not contest the results, the victory came about because of Chavez's gross misuse of government funds, government workers and federal facilities for the campaign, and neighborhood enforcers to ""persuade"" voters to support him. He lost a similar vote 14 months ago, but was clearly determined to become president-in-perpetuity and to have Venezuelans vote until they voted his way. Chavez says the people have chosen to make his Bolivarian Revolution permanent. Maybe. But this was not democracy in action. It was the latest accretion of power by a president who essentially controls the Congress, the Supreme Court and the National Electoral Council, which supervises elections. Campaigning relentlessly, Chavez cast the vote as a referendum not just on term limits but on him personally and on voters' commitment to socialist ideology. It was a tussle between those who love the president for his allegiance to the nation's poor -- Chavez warned that his education, health care and business programs for the underprivileged would end with his term in 2013 if he lost -- and those who fear him as a power-seeking autocrat. But these are not contradictory views: Chavez is a dictatorial executive, albeit one who gives ordinary Venezuelans a share in the nation's oil wealth -- even, some economists believe, at the expense of the country's long-term economic health. It is important, however, that the U.S. not allow Venezuela's domestic politics to hinder our diplomatic efforts in the region. The Bush administration's mix of incompetence and swagger -- its emphasis on useless drug eradication and eschewing of poverty reduction -- played into Chavez's hands, allowing him to paint the U.S. as an elitist menace. It is sobering that in supporting Chavez, many Venezuelans also saw themselves as opposing the United States. So, as much as we deplore what looks like the incremental disintegration of democracy in Venezuela, the U.S. must re-engage with Chavez. There are many issues of mutual interest and importance to both countries: trade, immigration, economic development, drug policy and a resolution to the leftist guerrilla conflict across the border in Colombia. Chavez has joked that he plans to stay in office until 2049. And Sunday's vote shows that in crafting its policy for Latin America, the Obama administration will have to take him seriously.","{'workers', 'control', 'poverty', 'development', 'poor'}",0.09056693113122108

The Constitution stipulates mineral resources are owned by the state. The ""Mineral Resources Law"" explicitly states that the State Council exercises the state ownership of the mineral resources. In recent years, China has reformed the management system for mineral resources prospecting and mining rights, clearly defined the property right attribute of the prospecting and mining rights, and established the system of acquisition of the prospecting and mining rights with compensation and the transfer of them according to law. China has established a legal system whereby the holder of the prospecting right enjoys priority in acquiring the mining right in the area explored, and strengthened the exclusiveness of the prospecting and mining rights. It has changed the limits of authority regarding giving approval to mineral resources prospecting and exploitation and issuing the prospecting and mining licenses. The prospecting and mining rights can be obtained with compensation by such means as competition through bidding, auction and listing. The transfer of prospecting or mining rights shall follow the market rules, be subject to approval from government departments, and go through the procedure for transfer according to law. The Chinese government will continue to cultivate and standardize the prospecting and mining rights market, and exercise stricter supervision and control over the operation of the market in accordance with the requirements of clearly defined ownership, complete rules, effective regulation and control, and standard operation. -- Improving the system of compensation for the use of mineral resources. China's ""Mineral Resources Law"" clearly provides for the system of compensation for the use of mineral resources. The Chinese government started levying compensation fees for mineral resources from the holders of mining rights in 1994, thus terminating the history of compensation-free mining in China. The collection of the compen-sation fees for mineral resources (fees for the use of mining areas in cooperative development of petroleum resources offshore or onshore) embodies the rights and interests of the state as the owner of the min-eral resources, and is conducive to establishing an economic incentive mechanism to promote the protection and rational utilization of min-eral resources. The compensation fees for mineral resources collected by the Chinese government are included in the state budget; they are specially managed and used chiefly in mineral resources prospecting. Holders of mining rights who conform to the stipulations of the laws and statutes shall have their compensation fees remitted or reduced. The Chinese government has stipulated that, beginning in 1998, it will collect fees for the use of prospecting and mining rights, and the costs for the prospecting and mining rights formed in the course of prospecting with state investment from the holders of the prospecting and mining rights. Fees and costs for the use of prospecting and mining rights shall be remitted or reduced for mineral resources exploration and exploitation, which meet the requirements, in the western regions, regions inhabited by ethnic minorities, remote and poor regions designated by the government, and offshore areas.

LTW_ENG_20050102.0005,"Help for Indonesia. The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON -- As the full horror of last week's earthquake and tsunami in southern Asia slowly becomes known, Indonesia is emerging as the center of one of the biggest natural disasters in history -- and as a focal point for concern about long-term social, economic and political aftershocks. Two-thirds of the death toll, which by the weekend had risen to more than 120,000, has been recorded in and around the island of Sumatra, and particularly within the poor, isolated and war-torn province of Aceh. With one sizable town just 60 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, Aceh suffered an extraordinary double blow: first a shock wave about 200 times as powerful as the Los Angeles earthquake of 1994; then a tsunami that sent waves from the seashore to the foot of mountains more than a mile inland. The town of Meulaboh, once home to 120,000 people, may have lost a third of its population last Sunday morning. Lagoons stand where once there were thousands of homes. At least half a million people have been displaced, and disease and famine still threaten those who survive. Beyond the immediate humanitarian emergency, the disaster will pose a critical challenge to stability in the world's largest predominately Muslim country, a fledgling democracy that was just beginning to find its feet when the earthquake struck. With a population of 238 million spread over 17,000 islands, Indonesia has been the site of some of the greatest threats and most hopeful developments in the war on terrorism. Islamic militants linked to al-Qaida have carried out three major bombings in the past two years, and they pose an ongoing threat. But the country is also a center for moderate Islamic thinking, and three democratic elections were successfully staged there last year. The last, in September, handed the presidency to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a moderate former general who hopes to consolidate secular civilian rule and prove that democracy can bring Indonesia the booming economic growth it experienced under dictatorship in the 1980s and '90s. U.S. relations with Indonesia are friendly but uneasy: As elsewhere in the Muslim world, President Bush is deeply unpopular. The administration consequently has not only an urgent interest in supporting a democratic government in its moment of crisis but also an opportunity to earn desperately needed goodwill by responding aggressively and generously. Regrettably, Bush got off to a slow start, failing to speak publicly about the disaster for three days and initially committing less government aid than American citizens and businesses have volunteered. By the end of the week a policy more equal to the challenge was emerging: Bush multiplied the U.S. aid pledge by 10, dispatched two naval battle groups to the Indian Ocean and delegated Secretary of State Colin Powell as well as his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to travel to the region beginning today. The U.S. delegation has a lot of ground to cover: Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, among other affected nations, are also important American friends. But as it fashions a post-disaster policy, the administration should ensure that the United States is second to none in providing short- and long-term relief to Indonesia. From this terrible tragedy, some good -- in the form of deeper American support for a struggling Islamic country -- can still come.","{'shocks', 'famine', 'disasters', 'development', 'poor', 'natural disaster'}",0.0829980536615112

Today the territory is familiar but the danger is different, as the United States awaits the aftershocks of a global economic crisis. As The Times reported in a series of articles last week, no one forecast the start of the new contagion in Asia two years ago. Nor did many foresee how it would spread quickly to Russia and Latin America. Rich nations and investors were blind to the weaknesses of the worldwide boom, and their initial ``solutions'' when the collapse started often made things worse. Now there is no clear path out of the morass. The Times series dispelled any temptation to be complacent about the American economy's supposed imperviousness to distant trends. In an era of interconnectedness, American farmers, steelworkers and ordinary citizens dependent on investments and pension funds were shown already to have been hurt. The horrendous human cost overseas could also be seen in the vanished hopes of rickshaw drivers, entrepreneurs and fledgling investors whose families had been reduced almost overnight to poverty and hunger.

ON AUG. 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, and it soon became clear what happens when the federal government is impotent or indifferent in time of need. The third anniversary of that storm Friday - not to mention the advance of Tropical Storm Gustav across the Caribbean Sea this week - offers an apt occasion to consider how the response might have been different under Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain. In the early days of the Katrina crisis, the Bush administration simply blew it. After Katrina's storm surge broke through the city's levees, most of New Orleans flooded with water - endangering those who couldn't or wouldn't evacuate and overwhelming the capacity of state and local agencies to provide help. It was well known that a major hurricane could cause cataclysmic damage, and yet the Bush administration had failed to mobilize federal emergency workers en masse until after Katrina hit. The consequences, of course, were horrifying. As bedraggled storm victims trudged aimlessly along elevated expressways, as thousands stood outside the Louisiana Superdome in searing heat, as senior citizens died in their homes for lack of food, water, or medical attention, the White House moved quickly to pin the blame on frantic local Democratic officials - and moved slowly in every other way. When thousands of evacuees found makeshift shelter at the New Orleans convention center, Michael Brown, the clueless Bush appointee who led the Federal Emergency Management Agency, gave a TV interview in which he appeared to know little, and care less, about their plight. Chastened by this poor performance and the deluge of criticism it provoked, Bush promised to do whatever was necessary to help bring the disaster area back. But federal aid paled against the vast scale of the disaster - and a disproportionate share of it went to Republican-controlled Mississippi. And the administration was slow to recognize one of the key obstacles to wise redevelopment of flooded-out areas in greater New Orleans: the financial calamity facing tens of thousands of property owners who faced financial ruin because they held mortgages on worthless homes.","{'workers', 'control', 'property', 'development', 'poor'}",0.07838301384448329

 Clough is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.. The first shots in what could prove to be the most significant battle of the new global era are being fired: Who controls the emerging international information highway? The struggle pits government officials intent on preserving national authority against ``netizens'' of an emerging cyber/civil society that refuses to recognize international boundaries. One of the first major battlegrounds is almost certain to be China. Earlier this month, the Chinese State Council authorized the Xinhua News Agency, the government's mouthpiece, to supervise the activities of all foreign news agencies selling economic information in China. Shortly thereafter, one senior Chinese official warned that outside information services would be more tightly regulated to protect Chinese secrets, privacy and property rights. It also was reported that the State Council was restricting the number of Internet providers and ordering existing providers to stop processing new-user registrations. Beijing's actions should not be surprising. Despite dramatic economic reforms that have enlarged its playing field for Chinese entrepreneurs and international investors, China is the world's most stubborn defender of state control over civil society -- at a time when the Internet is fast becoming global civil society's chief weapon. Global civil society consists of two sectors: the private economic, which is dominated by large and increasingly stateless corporations and worldwide investors, and the independent, which is composed of non-governmental organizations, political movements and transnational ethnic groups. In the old world order, both sectors were heavily dependent on the whims and will of national governments. During the last decade, global civil society has grown exponentially. Two developments -- the end of the Cold War and a general crisis of confidence in national governments around the world  -- created an opportunity for both the corporate and independent sectors to expand. But neither would have grown as rapidly without the communications revolution. For example, the international investment funds and global corporate management and production structures that now exist would have been inconceivable without the advent of computers, faxes and high-speed data transmission. These same technologies enabled human rights activists, women groups and other independent groups to form alliances across national borders.","{'control', 'entrepreneur', 'property', 'development', 'human rights'}",0.0779361110286049

We're proud to be doing this. We admire people who do this well. We reward them.' It happened in business and it's exactly what you're seeing at the moment in the citizen sector.'' J. Gregory Dees, who teaches social entrepreneurship at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said: ``I'm seeing two broad trends. One is a shift away from the idea of this sector being primarily about charity and the transfer of wealth to being about a desire to find more systemic and sustained solutions to social problems. And the other is an increased openness to experimenting with business methods and market-based approaches.'' These days, donors are more apt to stop financing organizations that cannot demonstrate their effectiveness. Some winning ideas, on the other hand, are rewarded. The Grameen Bank and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a citizen organization, have been so successful in alleviating poverty and educating millions of villagers that they have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of financing from around the globe. More than a thousand development programs worldwide are emulating their experiences. Some activists fear too much competition, arguing that groups can be more effective by forming coalitions. ``We need to find better ways to cooperate with one another if we are going to advocate effectively,'' said Laurie Regelbrugge, the chief operating officer of Civicus, an international network of citizen organizations. Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at the Yale School of Management, points to a different kind of problem: that growth does not necessarily lead to productivity gains unless accompanied by market discipline. ``There are too many nonprofits today and the reason is simply the difficulty in getting them to merge,'' Nalebuff said. ``In the for-profit sector, if an organization is doing poorly, somebody can take it over. There is no such thing as a nonfriendly acquisition in this sector.

Based on census data for 2004, half of all U.S. family income goes to 20 percent of the population. Various theories explain inequality, including government favoritism and special interest programs. The increase in female-headed households, which tend to be poorer, and in two-income households, which are more affluent, may be factors, as are the decline of labor unions and wage cuts by business. Not surprisingly, Forbes asserts that ""the driving force behind income inequality has been the development of meritocracy -- workers get what they're worth. And in periods of boundless technological innovation, like the present, brains and talent are suddenly worth a lot more."" Entrepreneurs have more fun The other Fortune -- Fortune Small Business (October) -- takes issue with the idea that entrepreneurs have to work harder than corporate employees to succeed. The secret that veteran business owners often keep to themselves is that entrepreneurs have more fun, and not just at the office. A recent study showed that 30 percent of owners of small businesses may work more than 60 hours a week, but thanks to technology they can control when and where to put in those hours. FSB profiles 14 entrepreneurs who use clever time management, delegation and wireless gadgets to get themselves away from the office. Their leisurely pursuits include martial arts, hiking, off-road racing, roller-coaster riding, working with disabled kids, flying vintage planes, playing polo, restoring antique cars, and collecting modern art.","{'workers', 'control', 'entrepreneur', 'development', 'poor'}",0.0737760941592197

(15). 5. Establishing a Personnel Training System and Improving the Quality of Disaster Relief Personnel Education of disaster prevention and reduction personnel are incorporated into the national talent development program. A national education system and a training platform for disaster reduction have been gradually established. -- Incorporating disaster reduction into the national education system. Efforts have been made to strengthen personnel training and education, train multi- tiered disaster prevention and reduction personnel by making use of disaster reduction research and the academic advantages of institutions of higher learning; strengthen academic system building for disaster prevention and reduction. Within the framework of the current financial management system, financial support is given to universities and technical colleges that run courses in disaster prevention and reduction, or have established majors in disaster prevention and reduction management and technology, in order to improve the quality of relevant personnel. -- Incorporating disaster prevention and reduction into the training programs for officials. In line of the needs of personnel training, colleges of administration and schools for officials at various levels in China have opened training courses on disaster prevention and reduction, and emergency management. National emergency management personnel training bases are under construction, which will provide disaster prevention and reduction as well as emergency management training to senior civil servants, senior executives of enterprises and public institutions, and senior theoretical workers. A national earthquake emergency rescue training base has been established and put in operation. -- Offering special training courses on disaster emergency management for leading officials. Classes on disaster emergency management for leading officials at the provincial level and classes on unexpected incidents emergency management for officials at the provincial and ministerial level have been held. The participants were leading officials of provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) and relevant departments of the State Council who were responsible for disaster prevention and reduction, and emergency management work. Since 2005, special training in disaster emergency management for civil servants has been actively carried out, which has effectively helped to improve the overall quality and ability of disaster emergency management personnel at various levels in preventing and dealing with natural disasters and other unexpected incidents. In 2005 and 2006, four special training courses on disaster emergency management for city- and prefecture-level officials were held. Since 2006, four training courses have been held on flood control and drought combat for city- and prefecture-level administrative officials in charge of flood control and drought combat.","{'disasters', 'workers', 'control', 'development', 'natural disaster'}",0.06970142156869888

When the leaders paradoxically came to an understanding of principles, they annexed the Muslim areas in east Bosnia to the Croatian-Bosnian federation, but annexed the Serb territories in west Bosnia to the Serbs. But now there is hardly a Serb in all of west Bosnia _ and in east Bosnia, except for the enclave in Gorazde, there is not a Bosnian. The peace efforts of the government community now stand to begin anew. The formula of 51 to 49 percent, as well as the contact group plan's map, have tried to calculate ethnic conditions and military strength since the summer of 1994. These methods will not withstand the developments of today. The contact group plan is yesterday's solution to the question of legitimate peace for Bosnia, which, as of today, has not been answered. ___ Aftonbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on Bosnia: The U.N. mission in Bosnia is drawing to an end. The secretary-general has suggested to the Security Council that it's time for ``regional organizations'' to take over the peace process. The U.N. gives up at the same time as Croatian and Bosnian troops advance in former Serb villages and cities in Bosnia, creating a new map. ... NATO's air strikes have facilitated the offensive and among the Serbs a new myth about being a persecuted people is developing. That picture, true or not, does not facilitate future coexistence. The difficult question about how the Croatians and Muslims should divide the power between them in their Bosnian federation after they've forced the Serbs to retreat has not yet been dealt with. ... NATO, in reality (the United States), took over the leading role when the U.N. proved unable to accomplish its mission. But why has the U.N. been so powerless? Because (the United States) has insisted on going its own way. In Somalia, the U.N. was left in the lurch, in Haiti the U.N. abided by (the United States') initiatives. In Bosnia, (the United States) refused to deploy ground troops under the U.N. command. ___ The Australian, Sydney, Australia, on the U.N. women's conference: The United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women was a qualified success. The major achievement was to craft, for the first time in a U.N. document, a consensual definition of women's sexual rights. Delegates from more than 180 nations accepted that ``the human rights of women include the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.'' This is a blueprint for activists setting out to win over their constituents and national governments to universal ideas for the advancement of women. That is where the real value of the Beijing conference will be determined. ... The conference was never going to be a harbinger of sweeping reforms to lift the status of women _ especially women outside the liberal industrialized nations. The U.N.'s role is to attempt a convergence of understanding about the different social, cultural and religious values that shape the world's societies. ___ La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Pope John Paul II in Africa: ``The Polish Pope suffers from Africa sickness,'' someone said ironically during the first years of Wojtila's pontificate, characterized, in truth, by a dramatic exploration of the Black Continent. (Pope John Paul II's) latest trip there seems to indicate the willingness to destroy, after the Berlin Wall, The Wall of Darkness and of Silence. That which is still separating Africa from the rest of the world. The Indifference Wall through which the ``Internet Society'' looks at the drift of a whole continent. Indeed, we notice Africa only when epidemics, disasters, famines or AIDS slaughter break out there, or during the Pope's visit: the only ``great'' who goes there, also because within five years, there will be more than one hundred million African Catholics. Thus, the concept that Africa has become a ``branch of Hell''is more than ever believable. Yet, Africa is behind the corner, close to us ..., inside our conscience, where our guilt grows. Some say Africans themselves are largely responsible for their misfortune: after 35 years of independence roughly nothing has changed. But there's no corrupt without a corruptor. Africa is the other face of our wealth; actually, with more thought, it is above all the brutal evidence of what the Christian West gave to the Black Continent: A punch in the stomach. Worse, an overdose of presumptuousness mixed with illusion. ___ MORE","{'famine', 'disasters', 'control', 'development', 'human rights'}",0.059173533389297706
