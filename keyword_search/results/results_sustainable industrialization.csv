XIN_ENG_20071024.0221,"Full text of Hu Jintao's report at 17th Party Congress (8). All this shows that through the unremitting efforts we have made since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, particularly since the introduction of the reform and opening up policy, China has scored achievements in development that have captured world attention, and experienced far-reaching changes in the productive forces and the relations of production, as well as in the economic base and the superstructure. However, the basic reality that China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come has not changed, nor has Chinese society's principal contradiction - the one between the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and the low level of social production. The current features of development in China are a concrete manifestation of that basic reality at this new stage in the new century. Stressing recognition of the basic reality is not meant to belittle ourselves, wallow in backwardness, or encourage unrealistic pursuit of quick results. Rather, such recognition will serve as the basis of our endeavor to advance reform and plan for development. We must always remain sober-minded, base our efforts on the most significant reality that China is in the primary stage of socialism, scientifically analyze the new opportunities and challenges arising from China's full involvement in economic globalization, fully understand the new situation and tasks in China's advance toward an industrialized, information-based, urbanized, market-oriented and internationalized country, have a good grasp of the new issues and problems we face in development, follow more conscientiously the path of scientific development, and strive to open up a broader vista for developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Scientific Outlook on Development takes development as its essence, putting people first as its core, comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement, and overall consideration as its fundamental approach. - We must regard development as the top priority of the Party in governing and rejuvenating the country. Development is of decisive significance for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and speeding up socialist modernization. We must firmly commit ourselves to the central task of economic development, concentrate on construction and development, and keep releasing and developing the productive forces. We must better implement the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, the strategy of strengthening the nation with trained personnel and the strategy of sustainable development. We must grasp the law of development, make innovations in our thinking, transform the mode of development, crack hard issues and raise quality and efficiency to achieve sound and rapid development, so that we can lay a solid foundation for developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must strive for scientific development by putting people first and making it comprehensive, balanced and sustainable; we must strive for harmonious development by integrating all undertakings and promoting unity and amity among all members of society; and we must strive for peaceful development in the course of which China develops itself by safeguarding world peace and contributes to world peace by developing itself. - We must always put people first. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental purpose of the Party, and its every endeavor is for the well-being of the people. We must always make sure that the aim and outcome of all the work of the Party and the state is to realize, safeguard and expand the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people. We must respect the principal position of the people in the country's political life, give play to their creativity, protect their rights and interests, take the path of prosperity for all and promote their all-round development, to ensure that development is for the people, by the people and with the people sharing in its fruits.

(ADDS quotations, background). Free world trade and innovation are critical to economic development even at the cost of a shifting jobs landscape, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday. Greenspan drew on the history of rural American development to rebut protectionism amid deepening concern over the loss of US jobs to countries with cheaper labor such as India and China. ""The phenomenal gains in US agricultural productivity of the past century brought profound benefits to all consumers, regardless of their connection to a farm, in the form of lower prices, better quality, and more choices at retail outlets,"" he told a rural development conference in Virginia, according to a copy of the speech released here. ""But those gains also have been associated with dislocations in many rural areas, largely in the form of migration of farm workers to more urban areas and the resulting eclipse of many small towns and villages,"" Greenspan said. ""Although dislocations are bound to accompany economic growth, we should give rise to the challenges that come with innovation because innovation brings great improvements in material well-being.""","{'well-being', 'innovation', 'development', 'economic development'}",0.1921359028831368

Promoting Sound and Rapid Development of the National Economy To attain the objectives for economic development, it is essential to significantly accelerate the transformation of the development pattern and improve the socialist market economy. We need to vigorously push forward strategic economic restructuring and make greater efforts to improve China's capacity for independent innovation as well as energy and environmental conservation, and to enhance the overall quality of the economy and its international competitiveness. We need to deepen our understanding of the laws governing the socialist market economy, introduce institutions to give better play to the basic role of market forces in allocating resources, and form a system of macroeconomic regulation conducive to scientific development. 1. Enhance China's capacity for independent innovation and make China an innovative country. This is the core of our national development strategy and a crucial link in enhancing the overall national strength. We need to keep to the path of independent innovation with Chinese characteristics and improve our capacity for independent innovation in all areas of modernization. We need to conscientiously implement the Outline of the National Program for Long- and Medium-Term Scientific and Technological Development (2006-20), increase spending on independent innovation, and make breakthroughs in key technologies vital to our economic and social development. We will speed up forming a national innovation system and support basic research, research in frontier technology and technological research for public welfare. We will step up our efforts to establish a market-oriented system for technological innovation, in which enterprises play the leading role and which combines the efforts of enterprises, universities and research institutes, and guide and support the concentration of factors of innovation in enterprises, thereby promoting the translation of scientific and technological advances into practical productive forces. We will deepen reform of the system for managing science and technology, optimize the allocation of relevant resources, and improve the legal guarantee, policy system, incentive mechanism and market conditions to encourage technological innovation and the application of scientific and technological achievements in production. We will implement the strategy for intellectual property rights. We will make the best use of international resources of science and technology. We will continue to create conditions conducive to innovation, work to train world-class scientists and leaders in scientific and technological research, attach great importance to training innovative personnel in the frontline of production, inspire the creative wisdom of the whole society and bring forth large numbers of innovative personnel in all areas. 2. Accelerate transformation of the mode of economic development and promote upgrading of the industrial structure. This is a pressing strategic task vital to the national economy as a whole. We must keep to the new path of industrialization with Chinese characteristics, pursue the policy of boosting domestic demand, particularly consumer demand, and propel three transitions in the mode of economic growth: the transition from relying mainly on investment and export to relying on a well coordinated combination of consumption, investment and export, the transition from secondary industry serving as the major driving force to primary, secondary and tertiary industries jointly driving economic growth, and the transition from relying heavily on increased consumption of material resources to relying mainly on advances in science and technology, improvement in the quality of the workforce and innovation in management. We will develop a modern industrial system, integrate IT application with industrialization, push our large industries to grow stronger, invigorate the equipment manufacturing industry, and eliminate outdated production capacities. We will upgrade new- and high-technology industries and develop information, biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, marine and other industries. We will develop the modern service industry and raise the level of the service sector and its share in the economy. We will step up efforts to improve basic industries and infrastructure and accelerate development of a modern energy industry and a comprehensive transport system. We will ensure the quality and safety of products. We will encourage formation of internationally competitive conglomerates.

We must accelerate social development with improving people's livelihood as the priority, ensure and improve people's livelihood, advance social restructuring, expand public services, improve social management, properly handle contradictions among the people, promote social equity and justice, and advance the building of a harmonious socialist society. The congress holds that bearing in mind the overall strategic interests of national security and development, we must take both economic and national defense development into consideration, and make our country prosperous and our armed forces powerful while building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. The congress stresses that we must unswervingly implement the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" under which Hong Kong people administer Hong Kong and Macao people administer Macao with a high degree of autonomy, act in strict accordance with the basic laws of the two special administrative regions, and promote long- term prosperity and stability in these regions.

The congress stresses that the Party must improve itself in a spirit of reform and innovation so as to stand in the forefront of the times and lead the people in opening up new prospects for developing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. To achieve the main objectives of strengthening the Party's governance capability and vanguard nature, we must ensure that the Party exercises self-discipline and is strict with its members, and work to fulfill the requirement for serving the people and being pragmatic and incorruptible. We must comprehensively strengthen the Party ideologically, organizationally and institutionally, improve its style of work and enhance its capacity to fight corruption and uphold integrity. All this will enable the Party to remain a ruling Marxist party that is built for public interests and exercises governance for the people; a party that is realistic, pragmatic and committed to reform and innovation; a party that is hardworking, clean and full of vigor and enjoys solidarity and harmony; and a Party that stays as the firm core of leadership for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The congress emphasizes that resolutely punishing and effectively preventing corruption bears on the popular support for the Party and on its very survival, and is therefore a major political task the Party must attend to at all times.

XIN_ENG_20100410.0315,"Full text of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's speech at
opening plenary of BFA  Annual Conference 2010 (2). China has worked actively and seriously to tackle global climate change and build capacity to respond to it. We believe that every country has a stake in dealing with climate change and every country has a responsibility for the safety of our planet. China is at a critical stage of building a moderately prosperous society on all fronts, and a key stage of accelerated industrialization and urbanization. Yet, despite the huge task of developing the economy and improving people’s lives, we have joined global actions to tackle climate change with the utmost resolve and a most active attitude, and have acted in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities established by the United Nations. China voluntarily stepped up efforts to eliminate backward capacity in 2007, and has since closed a large number of heavily polluting small coal-fired power plants, small coal mines and enterprises in the steel, cement, paper-making, chemical and printing and dyeing sectors. Moreover, in 2009, China played a positive role in the success of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the ultimate conclusion of the Copenhagen Accord. In keeping with the requirements of the Copenhagen Accord, we have provided the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change with information on China’s voluntary actions on emissions reduction and joined the list of countries supporting the Copenhagen Accord. The targets released by China last year for greenhouse gas emissions control require that by 2020, CO2 emissions per unit of GDP should go down by 40% - 45% from the 2005 level, non-fossil energy should make up about 15% of primary energy consumption, and forest coverage should increase by 40 million hectares and forest stock volume by 1.3 billion cubic meters, both from the 2005 level. The measure to lower energy consumption alone will help save 620 million tons of standard coal in energy consumption in the next five years, which will be equivalent to the reduction of 1.5 billion tons of CO2 emissions. This is what China has done to step up the shift in economic development mode and economic restructuring. It contributes positively to Asia’s and the global effort to tackle climate change. Ladies and Gentlemen, Green and sustainable development represents the trend of our times. To achieve green and sustainable development in Asia and beyond and ensure the sustainable development of resources and the environment such as the air, fresh water, ocean, land and forest, which are all vital to human survival, we countries in Asia should strive to balance economic growth, social development and environmental protection. To that end, we wish to work with other Asian countries and make further efforts in the following six areas. First, shift development mode and strive for green development. To accelerate the shift in economic development mode and economic restructuring provides an important precondition for our efforts to actively respond to climate change, achieve green development and secure the sustainable development of the population, resources and the environment. It is the shared responsibility of governments and enterprises of all countries in Asia and around the world. We should actively promote a conservation culture and raise awareness for environmental protection. We need to make sure that the concept of green development, green consumption and a green lifestyle and the commitment to taking good care of Planet Earth, our common home are embedded in the life of every citizen in society.","{'industrialization', 'development', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.16434509983556328

Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development.      Why has the pace of fundamental innovation in military technologies slowed? Why, six years after 9/11, is there no mega-research project -- along the lines of the crash Manhattan Project that 62 years ago produced the first atomic bombs -- to address the plausible security threats to the United States in the 21st century? These two questions say a lot about how innovation happens today, and why concerns about national security, which once motivated civilian scientists and engineers to make crucial contributions to military technologies, may again shape innovation priorities. The short answer to both questions is that the nation lacks a grand technological challenge that might galvanize the interests and energies of talented researchers and propel them into close cooperation with war-fighters in pursuit of innovations that will enhance national security. Time and again in recent American history, civilians have played a crucial role in military technology. During World War II, tens of thousands of researchers worked on a myriad of projects of which the atomic bomb was only the best known and most dramatic. In 1958, after the Soviet Union launched the third in its series of Sputnik rockets, President Dwight D. Eisenhower rallied American scientists and engineers again, forming both NASA and an advanced research agency, both under the Pentagon. The post-Sputnik sense of urgency powered American innovation for decades, igniting the growth of the country's infant semiconductor and computer industries and laying the foundational technologies for the Internet.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.16101843546540204

It encourages the development of burgeoning industries with information technology, new materials, energy saving and environmental protection, life sciences, oceanic engineering and other high technologies as the precursor, so as to foster new economic growth. Accelerating the reform and adjustment of military industrial enterprises. China's defense-related science, technology and industry optimizes the organizational structure of military industrial enterprises and encourages competitive enterprises to carry out strategic reorganization on the basis of market demand and their own advantages, in compliance with the principle of specialized division of labor and large-scale production and with products and assets as the link. Military industrial enterprises are impelled to establish a modern enterprise system, accelerate the pace of ownership system restructuring, establish a standard parent-subsidiary system and a legal person management structure, and change their enterprise operational mechanism. Full play is given to the guiding role of the state's input, to lead and channel social funds into the development of the defense-related science, technology and industry and carry forward the diversification of investors. Through reforms and adjustments, the main body of the military industry is streamlined, and a new defense-related science, technology and industry system established, which features a small core, extensive cooperation and military potential reserved in civilian capability. Improving the innovation system of scientific research. Scientific research institutions engaged in innovation activities in basic research, strategic high-tech research and important public welfare research should expedite the establishment of a modern scientific research institution system according to the principle of clearly defined responsibilities and duties, scientific evaluation, orderly opening, and standard management. Market-oriented applied technology research and development institutions should speed up their transformation into enterprises run on a commercial basis.

During the past five years we established and put into practice the Scientific Outlook on Development, worked hard on economic development, deepened reform and opening up, ensured the wellbeing of the people, improved their lives, and promoted social harmony. We made great efforts and accomplished a great deal. 1. Improving macroeconomic regulation to promote steady and rapid economic development. We endeavored to make macroeconomic regulation more proactive, responsive and effective, with the focus on resolving major problems affecting economic operation. Over the past few years, we tightened controls on the supplies of land and credit, raised market access requirements, adjusted financial and monetary policies as needed, improved industrial policies and the land policy, adjusted the economic structure, shored up weak links and effectively regulated economic operation to address problems such as overheated growth in fixed asset investment, excessive supplies of money and credit, excessively large trade surplus, and weakness in agriculture, the foundation of the economy, which could cause economic development to become unstable, unbalanced and unsustainable. In response to changes in the economy, we have repeatedly made timely adjustments in the required reserve ratio and the benchmark interest rates for savings and loans in financial institutions and rescinded or reduced export tax rebates for resource products and products whose production is energy intensive or highly polluting. These macroeconomic regulatory measures produced significant results, and China's economy maintained steady and rapid development throughout the five- year period, without experiencing major fluctuations. We adopted a series of major measures related to institutions, policies and investment to increase grain production and rural incomes as a matter of priority and strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy. We completely rescinded the agricultural tax, livestock tax and tax on special agricultural products throughout China, reducing the burden on farmers by an average of 133.5 billion yuan per year. In addition, we set up a subsidy scheme for agriculture, instituting direct subsidies for grain producers, subsidies for superior crop varieties, subsidies for the purchase of agricultural machinery and tools, and general subsidies for agricultural production supplies and providing incentives to major grain-producing counties and subsidies to counties and townships with serious financial difficulties. Investment in agriculture and rural areas was greatly increased. Central government allocations for agriculture, rural areas and farmers reached 1.6 trillion yuan over the past five years, including nearly 300 billion yuan that was used for developing rural infrastructure. Local governments also substantially increased their input. During the five-year period, an additional 6.667 million hectares of farmland was equipped with water-saving irrigation facilities, methane gas was made available to 16.5 million more households, 1.3 million kilometers of rural roads were built or upgraded, and safe drinking water was provided to an additional 97.48 million rural residents. A system for the prevention and control of major animal diseases was set up, and the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza was prevented. These measures greatly encouraged farmers to grow more, gave a strong impetus to the development of a new socialist countryside and brought historic changes to rural China to the great satisfaction of hundreds of millions of rural people. Agricultural development played an important role in ensuring the overall stability and development of China's economy and society. We formulated the Outline of the National Program for Long- and Medium-Term Scientific and Technological Development, which contains comprehensive plans for the development of science and technology in China from 2006 through 2020 and calls for the launching of a number of major projects. This will have an important and far-reaching impact on efforts to strengthen China's capacity for independent innovation and make it an innovative country. Work in basic research and research in leading-edge technologies was intensified; a number of major innovations such as high-performance computers, third generation mobile communications, and super-hybrid rice were achieved; and a number of products that are competitive and carry Chinese intellectual property rights were developed.

(3). Working and living conditions continued to improve in rural areas. Implementation of the projects to reinforce dangerous reservoirs, and build auxiliary facilities and upgrade water- saving devices in large irrigated areas was sped up; work on the plan to upgrade large drainage pumping stations in the central region was completed ahead of schedule, and construction on a number of key water conservancy projects was begun. Development of water and power supplies, methane facilities and roads was further strengthened in rural areas. As a result, 48.24 million farmers benefited from the safe drinking water project; methane gas was made available to five million more households; an additional 391,000 kilometers of rural roads were built or upgraded last year. The project to encourage retailers to open stores in more townships and villages and the project to support 100 large wholesale markets for farm products and 100 large rural retail distributors both progressed smoothly. 4. Important progress was made in structural adjustment. Our capacity for independent innovation continued to increase. The newly revised Law on Scientific and Technological Advances was promulgated and implemented in 2008. The Outline of the National Program for Long- and Medium-Term Scientific and Technological Development was implemented smoothly and its supporting policies were further improved. Funding for scientific and technological innovation was increased significantly. Expenditures on science and technology from the central budget in 2008 totaled 116.3 billion yuan, up 16.4%. The 16 major state science and technology projects, including development of large- scale oil and gas fields and ultra-large scale integrated circuits, all entered the implementation phase. Smooth progress was made in implementing the National Key Technology R&D Program, the March 1986 High-Tech Program, the March 1997 Program for Basic Research, and other science and technology programs. The third phase of the Knowledge Innovation Program was fully launched. Development of major state science and technology infrastructure such as the large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope and the heavy ion research facility was completed, and they became operational. An additional 18 national engineering research centers were built in areas such as information technology, biotechnology and environmental protection; 76 more enterprise technology centers received state recognition; 90 enterprise technology centers received government support to enhance their innovation capacity. A 100 teraflops supercomputer was developed independently, and the new ARJ21-700 regional jet made a successful maiden flight. Development of high-tech industries and equipment manufacturing was accelerated. Thirteen projects to apply biomedicine, satellite and other high technologies in production were implemented smoothly; 37 more high-tech industrial bases were certified in areas such as information technology, biotechnology, new energy sources, new materials, civil aviation and civil aerospace; three licenses were issued for third generation mobile communications. The value-added of the 54 national new and high technology development zones rose 18.6% in 2008. The policy framework to reinvigorate the equipment manufacturing industry was constantly improved, and R&D on a number of major equipment and key facilities was carried out successfully. The final assembly line for Airbus A320 was put into operation in Tianjin; R&D on the key equipment of the experimental demonstration line for transmitting 1,000-kilovolt AC ultrahigh- tension power was carried out successfully; mass production of megawatt wind power facilities was started. In addition, we continued to shut down backward production facilities in accordance with the law. Small thermal power plants with a total power generating capacity of 16.69 million kilowatts and 1,054 small coalmines were shut down last year, and shutdowns also progressed smoothly in the cement, steel and electrolytic aluminum industries. The growth of production in energy intensive and highly polluting industries slowed down significantly, and mergers and reorganizations of competitive enterprises in the steel, coal and building-material industries were accelerated.

The American success story _ from Ben Franklin's bifocals to Thomas Edison's light bulb to Henry Ford's assembly line to today's advanced microprocessors _ is all about inventing our future. The companies we ran, Microsoft and DuPont, were successful because they invested deeply in new technologies and new ideas. But our country is neglecting a field central to our national prospect and security: energy. Although the information technology and pharmaceutical industries spend 5 to 15 percent of their revenue on research and development each year, U.S. companies' spending on energy R&D has averaged only about one- quarter of 1 percent of revenue over the past 15 years. And despite talk about the need for ""21st-century"" energy sources, federal spending on clean energy research _ less than $3 billion _ is also relatively small. Compare that with roughly $30 billion that the U.S. government annually spends on health research and $80 billion on defense research and development. As many have noted, an energy future built on yesterday's technology threatens to leave people exposed to price shocks (hurting Americans and devastating the world's poor) and would exacerbate our national security problems and increase our trade deficit, given our dependence on costly foreign oil. The science is also clear that without significant efforts to tackle the climate issue, the effects of warming will grow, undermining agriculture, making droughts and floods more common and more severe, and eventually destroying ecosystems. We need a vigorous strategy to invent our future and ensure its safety and prosperity.

XIN_ENG_19951116.0145,"Full Text of Chinese FM Statement at APEC Ministerial Meeting. The Action Agenda represents a common understanding on promoting the process of trade and investment liberalization. It therefore should be implemented on a voluntary and unilateral basis. We should move forward by gradually seeking common areas and start from easy items to difficult ones. This liberalization does not merely mean the lowering of tariffs or the reduction of trade barriers. It calls for even greater efforts to create a stable and favorable trading environment and to observe fair and equitable trade regulations. The principle of non-discrimination ensures equal benefits for all APEC members. It must form the very basis for economic and trade cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, and must be observed throughout the whole process liberalization. Since great disparity exists among APEC members in their levels of economic development, top priority must be given to economic and technical cooperation in the implementation of the Action Agenda. Enhancing regional economic and technical cooperation will not only help reduce and eliminate poverty and narrow economic gaps, but also contribute to further trade and investment liberalization. The APEC region has a population of 2 billion among which over 1.5 billion are in the developing members. Without a fundamental improvement in the livelihood of these 1.5 billion people, the so-called ""Asia-Pacific Century"" is out of the question. To ask developing members to open their markets, we must first of all help them build up their markets. Otherwise, the markets, even if they have come into being, will only be short-lived. This can be compared to ""killing a hen to get the eggs"", which means little farsightedness in business. Past experience shows that economic and technical cooperation is only possible with a rational flow of capital and technology and on a fair and mutually beneficial basis. At the end of the 1980s, and as a medium for technology transfer, foreign direct investment contributed effectively to economic growth and gradually rationalized the industrial structure of the region. This is a successful experience of economic and technical cooperation. APEC should and can play a big role in promoting industrial cooperation and should consider formulating appropriate framework and guidelines. In addition, priorities for economic and technical cooperation should include such important issues as developing the most precious human resources, increasing input into infrastructure and using clean technologies to protect our life-dependent environment. APEC has been in existence for six years. It now has come to a crucial stage of its development. Just as we need the Bogor Declaration to identify long-term goals for out future cooperation, we also need the Action Agenda to work out specific plans for our action. The thrust of the Action Agenda is its emphasis on actions. Beginning next year, China will implement its new Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Term Goals until the year 2010. These, in many ways, are in line with the process of regional economic cooperation. We believe that, so long as all the members give due regard to the diversity of the region, adopt a pragmatic approach and enhance consultation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we will surely achieve positive results with out actions.","{'clean technologies', 'development', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.12373845395238661

In addition, they said, the use of fossil fuels will have to decline, and to achieve these goals research will have to begin immediately. Without prompt action, the atmosphere's concentration of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, is expected to double from pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, the scientists said. ``A broad range of intensive research and development is urgently needed to produce technological options that can allow both climate stabilization and economic development,''the team said.

Efforts should be concentrated on mastering technologies that have a vital bearing on the country's economic and social development. It is essential to adhere to the principle of combining independent research and development with introduction of advanced foreign technology, adopting advanced manufacturing techniques and expanding China's own capacity of producing major installments. Second, vigorously developing high technology and hi-tech industries. The trend of world hi-tech development should be closely followed, and focus of development should be on hi-teches in the fields of electronic information, biology, new materials, new energy, aviation, space and marine technology, with an aim to approach or reach the world advanced level in some major fields. The high and new technologies should be actively applied to renovating traditional industries. Third, strengthening basic research. Aiming at the world's front areas of science, China should concentrate efforts on achieving break-throughs in the fields where China has a cutting edge. The reform on scientific and technological management system should be intensified to establish a mechanism combining research, development, production and marketing so as to raise the capacity of development and innovation. The structure of scientific institutes should be optimized in line with the principle of ""stabilizing some institutes while giving free scope to others"", promoting the rational flow of trained personnel. The cooperation and integration between research bodies, institutes of higher learning and enterprises should be strengthened. This will give a push to scientific institutes in their effort to join hands with large enterprise groups and encourage enterprises to set up more technological development centers so that enterprises become the main force of technological development. Vitalizing science and technology and invigorating the national economy must be based on education. Emphasis must be put on popularing compulsory education, while actively developing vocational education and adult education, appropriately developing the higher education and optimizing the educational structure. By the year 2,000, nine-year compulsory education will have been basically popularized, and illiteracy among youth and adults basically eliminated. It is necessary to speed up reform of educational system, raise educational quality and efficiency of running schools. Efforts should be made to explore new modes and mechanisms of running schools that are suited to a socialist market economy, establish step-by-step a new mode for running schools with combined efforts of the government as the main investors and the broad participation of all social sectors. Various kinds of partnerships in running schools are advocated so as to optimize and make good use of existing educational resources. The institutes of higher learning should be administered at the central or provincial level, with the provincial level being the main form. For the non-compulsory education, it is necessary to gradually introduce the method of paying for one's own education but enjoying freedom of choosing jobs.

XIN_ENG_19981124.0119,"Full Text of Jiang's Speech in Science City of Novosibirsk. ...a country to prosperity. China is one of the cradles of world civilization. Its education and science both have a glorious history. The ancient Chinese science and technology symbolized by the four famous inventions--paper-making, gun powder, printing and compass had once tremendously influenced the development process of human civilization and profoundly changed the face of world civilization. Since the founding of New China, especially over the past 20 years of reform and opening-up, the Chinese Government has always attached great importance to the development of science, technology and education. The well-known conclusion that ""science and technology constitute a primary productive force"" drawn by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is now becoming an important idea guiding China's development. We have given a prominent position to the strategy of economic development through science-technology and education and a sustainable development strategy when drawing up the blueprint for the modernization drive. Recently we have decided that the Chinese Academy of Sciences should take the lead in introducing a pilot programme of instituting a national knowledge innovation system. That is, to identify new objectives of scientific and technological development, readjust the existing operational mechanism, strive for more and greater scientific and technological innovations and put in place an innovation system for China in view of the need of a development strategy for China of the next century and the prospects of the world frontier sciences. In the 21st century, we will achieve a take-off in science and education so that China's modernization drive will be able to advance steadily along the path of development through scientific and technological progress and through improved quality of human resources. China pays close attention to enhanced exchanges and co-operation with the international scientific, technological and educational communities, and has made an effort to learn from and draw on the useful experience of other countries in developing science, technology and education. It is gratifying to see the smooth development of the scientific and technological exchanges and co-operation between China and Russia. The Siberia Science Center has established friendly ties and co-operation with many Chinese research institutes. The new Siberia Nuclear Physics Institute and Catalytic Institute have conducted fruitful co-operation with their counterparts in China. With strong scientific and technological capabilities, Russia has a huge potential for development. The difficulties now encountered by the Russian scientific and technological community are temporary ones, which could very well be overcome by the Russian people with endeavour. The scientific and technological strength is also growing in China, where there is a big market for scientific and technological products. All this promises a broad prospect for scientific and technological co-operation between China and Russia. In view of the above, I have specially included in my delegation Academician Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I would like to introduce him to you. To advance scientific research and technological progress, it is necessary to deepen our understanding of the objective world and to scientifically utilize, transform and protect nature so as to create better working and living conditions for mankind. I sincerely hope that the scientific and technological departments of our two countries will co-operate more closely and work for greater results to the benefit of our two peoples and the people of the world as a whole.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.11844771772443023

These major policy measures as a whole target both symptoms and root causes, and address both immediate and long-term concerns. They represent a holistic approach and are mutually reinforcing. They are designed to address the need to boost domestic demand, readjust and reinvigorate industries, encourage scientific innovation and strengthen social security. They are designed to stimulate consumption through increased investment, overcome the current difficulties with long-term development in mind, and promote economic growth in the interest of people's livelihood. These measures can mobilize all resources to meet the current crisis. China's economy is in good shape on the whole. We managed to maintain steady and relatively fast economic growth in 2008 despite two unexpected massive natural disasters. Our GDP grew by 9 percent. CPI was basically stable. We had a good grain harvest for the fifth consecutive year, with a total output of 528.5 million tons. Eleven million and one hundred and thirty thousand new jobs were created in cities and towns. Household income in both urban and rural areas continued to rise. The financial system functioned well and the banking system kept its liquidity and credit asset quality at a healthy level. When China, a large developing country, runs its affairs well, it can help restore confidence in global economic growth and curb the spread of the international financial crisis. It will also help increase China's imports and outbound investment, boost world economic growth and create more development and job opportunities for other countries. Steady and fast growth of China's economy is in itself an important contribution to global financial stability and world economic growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, Will China's economy continue to grow fast and steadily? Some people may have doubts about it. Yet I can give you a definite answer: Yes, it will. We are full of confidence. Where does our confidence come from? It comes from the fact that the fundamentals of China's economy remain unchanged. Thanks to our right judgment of the situation and prompt and decisive adjustment to our macroeconomic policy, our economy remains on the track of steady and fast development. Our package plan takes into consideration both the need to address current difficulties and that of long-term development. It is beginning to produce results and will be more effective this year. Our confidence comes from the fact that the long-term trend of China's economic development remains unchanged. We are in an important period of strategic opportunities and in the process of fast industrialization and urbanization. Infrastructure construction, upgrading of industrial and consumption structures, environmental protection and conservation projects, and various social development programs—all can be translated into huge demand and growth potential and will bolster relatively high-speed growth of our economy for a long time to come. Our confidence also comes from the fact that the advantages contributing to China's economic growth remain unchanged. With 30 years' of reform and opening-up, we have laid a good material, technological and institutional foundation. We have a large well- trained and relatively low-cost labor force. We have a healthy fiscal balance, a sound financial system and adequate funds. Our system enables us to mobilize the necessary resources for big undertakings. There is harmony and stability in our society. What is more important, we follow a scientific approach to development which puts people first and seeks comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development. We are committed to reform, opening-up and win-win progress. We have found the right development path in line with China's national conditions and the trend of our times. Our people are hard-working, persevering and resilient. It is precisely these fine qualities that endow China, a country with a time-honored history, with greater vitality in the face of adversities. At the same time, there is no fundamental change in the external environment for China's economic growth. The pursuit of peace, development and cooperation is the irreversible trend in today's world. The readjustment to the international division of labor offers new opportunities. We have the confidence, conditions and ability to maintain steady and fast economic growth and continue to contribute to world economic growth.

The most comprehensive study ever conducted on the effects of day care has found that young children in the care of others while their parents work generally suffer no disadvantage in cognitive or linguistic development. But the federally funded study, which so far has tracked more than 1,300 children from birth to three years of age, concluded that when a child spends long hours in ``nonmaternal'' care, the quality of interaction between that child and its mother is slightly eroded. The more hours a child spends in day care, the study showed, the more negative and less sensitive a mother was toward the child in situations observed by researchers. At two and three years old, a child cared for by others also was less affectionate toward his mother in proportion to the amount of day care the child received. Collectively, these measures of mother-child interaction are considered strong predictors of a child's sense of security in her mother, and in turn, of her overall emotional well-being. Researchers called the link between a child's hours in care and poor mother-child interaction weak but statistically significant. Dr. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which sponsored the study, called the finding that children's cognitive development is not harmed by day care ``the most striking aspect of these results.''","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'well-being'}",0.10755765730419249

The research report points out that Taiwan's telecommunications sector and communication networks may be at risk of being monitored by the authorities on mainland China, unless security measures are adopted before the liberalization of the market.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.10335884734667204

NYT_ENG_20020919.0023,"CASH DIVERTED FROM RESEARCH ON THE SPINE. In July 1998, Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law a program devoting part of the state's traffic fines to research on spinal cord injuries, a measure that was promoted by Christopher Reeve and other well-known paralyzed people. Most of the money that was earmarked for that research went unspent, and this year, at Pataki's behest, the state raided the program's trust fund, putting most of the money into the state's General Fund. The raid occurred as progress in spinal cord injury treatment, and Reeve's own small but remarkable advances after years of paralysis, have been very much in the news. The actor, whose neck was broken in a horseback-riding accident almost seven years ago, is profiled in the current issue of People magazine, and he is taking part this month in a series of events to draw attention to spinal injuries, including a fund-raiser next week to mark his 50th birthday. An administration spokesman said in an e-mail message that the governor intended to restore the money, though that is not a binding commitment. The spokesman, John Signor, said New York ``takes a back seat to no one in its support for outstanding spinal cord injury research.'' H. Carl McCall, who is running against the governor, said the program was ``yet another sad example of George Pataki's rhetoric not matching his real record.'' This story parallels one that the campaign of Pataki, a Republican, has been using to attack McCall, a Democrat. A 1999 state law authorized McCall as state comptroller to invest a fraction of the state pension fund in economic development in New York, but two years into the program, he has spent very little of the money, and much of what has spent has gone out of state. In each case, the charge is that the official has not lived up to the program's promise or used the money in the intended way. And in each case, the response is, in part, that getting a sophisticated new program running is difficult, and that worthy places to invest can be hard to find.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.10070936378543924

Change(2). Foreword Global climate change and its adverse effects are a common concern of mankind. Ever since the industrial revolution, human activities, especially the massive consumption of energy and resources by developed countries in the process of industrialization, have increased the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, produced conspicuous impacts on the natural ecosystems of the Earth, and posed severe challenges to the survival and development of human society. As a developing country with a large population, a relatively low level of economic development, a complex climate and a fragile eco-environment, China is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which has brought substantial threats to the natural ecosystems as well as the economic and social development of the country. These threats are particularly pressing in the fields of agriculture and livestock breeding, forestry, natural ecosystems and water resources, and in coastal and eco-fragile zones. Therefore, China's priority task at present is to adapt itself to climate change. The multiple pressures of developing the economy, eliminating poverty and mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases constitute difficulties for China in its efforts to cope with climate change, since the country is undergoing rapid economic development. A responsible developing country, China sets great store by climate change issues. Fully aware of the importance and urgency of addressing climate change, following the requirements of the Scientific Outlook on Development, and taking into overall consideration of both economic development and ecological construction, domestic situation and international situation, and present and future, China has formulated and implemented a national plan for coping with climate change, and adopted a series of policies and measures in this regard. China combines the handling of climate change with its execution of its sustainable development strategy, acceleration of building a resource-conserving and environmental-friendly society and construction of a country of innovation. Taking economic development as the core objective, and placing emphasis on energy conservation, optimization of the energy mix, reinforcement of ecological protection and construction, and scientific and technological progress as backup, China strives to control and mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases and continuously enhance the capability of adapting itself to climate change. China actively participates in worldwide efforts to address climate change, earnestly observes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, and plays a constructive role in international cooperation in this regard.

In a report to be presented at the World Bank on Friday, a group that includes senior government officials from 13 countries will urge nations to adopt open-information technology standards as a vital step to accelerate economic growth, efficiency and innovation. The 33-page report is a road map for creating national policies on open-technology standards and comes at a time when several countries -- and some state governments -- are pursuing plans to reduce their dependence on proprietary software makers, notably Microsoft, by using more free, open-source software. The project, begun by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at the Harvard Law School, gathered government officials from China, India, Thailand, Denmark, Jordan, Brazil and elsewhere at a three-day meeting in Silicon Valley in February to discuss technology standards and economic development. The meeting was followed by e-mail exchanges, conference calls and postings on a shared Web site. The group defines an open standard as technology that is not owned by a single company and is openly published. Still, there is a huge debate in industry and among policymakers about how far openness should go. The report makes clear that government policy should ""mandate technology choice, not software development models."" It also points out that open-technology standards -- the digital equivalent of a common gauge for railroad tracks -- are not the same as open-source software.

Economic strategic restructuring should be a major task in the transformation, said the communique released after the four-day plenum, which examined and approved the 12th Five-Year Program (2011-2015) for National Economic and Social Development. China aimed to reduce its dependence on investment and exports, which made it vulnerable to global economic recession, and efforts had been made to increase domestic demand through consumer subsidies and rising incomes. The communique said the CPC would continue the policy of boosting domestic demand, and push forward technology research and innovation.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.09703424518137138
XIN_ENG_20021117.0080,"Full text of Jiang Zemin's report at 16th Party congress (13). In taking a new road to industrialization, we must give play to the important role of science and technology as the primary productive force and pay close attention to improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth by relying on scientific and technological progress and raising the qualities of labor force. We must strengthen basic research and research in high technology, promote key technological innovation and systems integration so that technology will develop by leaps and bounds. We must encourage scientific and technological innovation and acquire key technology and independent intellectual property rights in key areas and a number of domains in frontier science and technology. We must deepen the reform of the administration systems of science, technology and education, strengthen the integration of science, technology and education with the economy, improve the service system for the development of science and technology and quicken the pace of translating research achievements into practical productive forces. We must press ahead with the building of a national innovation system. We must give play to the role of venture capital and develop a mechanism of capital operation and human capital pooling for promoting scientific and technological innovation and start-ups. We must improve the system of intellectual property rights protection. We must give top priority to sustainable development, adhere to the basic state policies of family planning and environmental and resources protection, keep the birthrate low and rationally develop and economically utilize all kinds of natural resources. We must lose no time in solving the problem of water shortages in some areas and build the south- to-north water diversion project. We should promote marine development and do well in the comprehensive improvement of land and resources. It is necessary to help the whole nation see the importance of environmental protection and do a good job of ecological conservation and improvement. 2. Make the rural economy flourish and speed up urbanization. A major task for building a well-off society in an all-round way is to make overall planning for urban and rural economic and social development, build modern agriculture, develop the rural economy and increase the income of farmers. We must strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation of the economy, carry on the restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy, protect and raise the comprehensive grain production capacity, improve the system for ensuring the quality of farm produce and enhance the competitiveness of agriculture in the market. We must push forward the industrialized operation of agriculture, better organize farmers in their access to the market and improve the overall efficiency of agriculture. We must develop farm produce processing industry to boost the county economy. We must open up more rural markets and enliven the distribution of farm produce by improving its market system. It is an inevitable trend of industrialization and modernization for surplus rural labor to move to non-agricultural industries and to cities and towns. It is essential to raise the level of urbanization gradually and persist in the coordinated development of large, medium and small cities and small towns along the path to urbanization with Chinese characteristics. We should develop small towns on the basis of existing county seats and of organic towns where conditions permit, make scientific planning and a rational layout, integrating their development with the expansion of township and village enterprises and the rural service sector. All the institutional and policy barriers to urbanization must be removed and the rational and orderly flow of rural labor guided. We must adhere to the basic rural policies of the Party and keep stabilizing and improving the two-tier management system that integrates unified with separate management on the basis of household contract management. Wherever conditions permit, the transfer of the contractual right of land can be carried out according to law and on a voluntary and compensatory basis so as to develop scale operation step by step. We must respect farmer households as market players and encourage innovation in the rural management system. We must enhance the economic strength of the collectives. We should establish and improve a commercialized rural service system. We must invest more in agriculture, give it more support and accelerate the progress of agricultural science and technology and the building of rural infrastructure. We should improve financial services in rural areas. We must continue with the reform in tax and fee in rural areas to lighten the burdens of farmers and protect their interests.

After blue-sky thinking and random experimentation, they build new products without relying on neatly defined patents or published scientific papers -- the bread-and-butter of academic knowledge production. In the bygone days of innovation, large corporations -- like RCA, Xerox and the old AT&amp;T -- maintained internal laboratories like Bell Labs.

Frontier technology, as a new potential driving force for energy development, can blaze the way for the leapfrogging development of energy industry and technologies. China focuses on research into conversion from fossil, biomass and renewable energy resources to hydrogen, and high-efficiency hydrogen storage, transmission and distribution technology. It also conducts research into the technology for the manufacturing of basic and key components of fuel cells, integration of fuel cell stacks, fuel cell power generation and automotive fuel cell power systems, and strives to make breakthroughs in the technology for the end-use energy conversion, storage and combined cooling, heating and power projection of fossil energy-based micro- miniature gas turbine systems. Meanwhile, the country is speeding up research into the engineering and core technology of gas-cooled faster reactors (GFR), and technology for developing magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) and natural gas hydrate technology. -- Developing basic scientific research. Basic research is the source of independent innovation and it determines the strength and potential of energy development. China concentrates on research into the basic theories of the high- efficiency and low-pollution utilization and conversion of fossil energy, key principles of high-efficiency heat-work conversion, high-efficiency energy saving and storage, basic technology for large-scale utilization of renewable energy, and basic theories concerning technology for large-scale utilization of nuclear and hydrogen energy resources. VI. Coordinating Energy and Environment Development Climate change is a significant global issue of worldwide concern. It is both an environmental and development issue, and intrinsically a development issue. The large-scale exploitation and utilization of energy resources is one of the major causes of environmental pollution and climate change. Appropriate handling of the relationship between the exploitation and utilization of energy resources on the one hand, and environmental protection and climate change on the other, is an urgent issue facing all countries. China is a developing country in the primary stage of industrialization, and with low accumulative emissions. From 1950 to 2002, the aggregate amount of China's fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions accounted for only 9.3 percent of the world's total in the same period. The amount of China's per-capita carbon dioxide emissions ranked 92nd in the world, and the elasticity coefficient of carbon dioxide emissions per-unit GDP was very small. As a responsible developing country, China attaches great importance to environmental protection and prevention of global climate change. The Chinese government has made environmental protection a fundamental state policy, signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, established the National Coordination Committee for Climate Change, submitted to the UN the Initial National Communication on Climate Change of the People's Republic of China, worked out the Management Measures on the Implementation of Clean Development Mechanism Projects, formulated the National Climate Change Program, and adopted a series of proactive policies and measures regarding environmental protection and climate change. China aims to achieve the goal of basically curbing the trend of ecological deterioration, reducing total emissions of major pollutants by 10 percent, and gain visible results in the control of greenhouse gas emissions during its 11th Five-Year Plan period (2006-2010). Meanwhile, the country is actively adjusting its economic and energy structures, comprehensively advancing energy saving, emphatically preventing and controlling the pressing problems of environmental pollution, and effectively controlling emissions of pollutants to facilitate coordinated development between energy and the environment.","{'industrialization', 'innovation', 'development', 'research'}",0.09304233120117353

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday signed off on a 75 million US dollars loan for the reform of Vietnam's finance sector, which will stimulate the country's economy and improve job creation.

NYT_ENG_20071021.0032,"WHEN THE MILITARY NEEDS IT YESTERDAY. The Pentagon has long indulged in highly polished technological systems that are the product of many years of bureaucratic wheel-spinning, grinding meetings and wish-list overkill. But those soul-deadening procedures have come under intense criticism for turning creative people away from innovation for national security. ""Innovations threaten the establishment, and the reaction is often to get rid of the person promoting the innovation,"" said Jay M. Cohen, the undersecretary for research and development in the Department of Homeland Security. Even when a military official advocates a new technological system, added Cohen, formerly chief of the Office of Naval Research, he or she runs the risk of being punished by resentful officers, protective of their turf. The military's appetite for expensive, gold-plated systems still exists, but soldiers increasingly want their civilian technology partners to deliver solutions quickly to the field, even if the devices are far from perfected. That is partly because changing conditions in the Iraq war have raised demand for new gadgets and gizmos, even in tiny batches. ""This is a major shift in outlook, and I believe it is a permanent shift,"" said Mark Sherman, who oversees efforts by BBN Technologies of Cambridge, Mass., a supplier of new technologies to the military since 1948. His advice to civilian innovators seeking military sales is this: ""Do it quick, and make it cheap because conditions change."" Consider the experience of BBN's shooter detection program, conceived in a rush four years ago. Asked by the Army to quickly help soldiers in Iraq who found themselves under sniper fire, BBN delivered 50 early versions of a system it called Boomerang in a mere 66 days. Using an array of microphones in a small box, the system tracks the location, elevation and distance of a shot fired at either a stationary soldier or a moving vehicle.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.08956069384658204

China should guarantee the implementation of a law on intellectual property protection and strengthen information collection and analysis, Lou noted. Research and development centers set up by multinationals and domestic companies should be encouraged to accumulate self-developed patent technology. Local companies' awareness of intellectual property should also be enhanced. He said there was still a big gap between China and developed countries in the information industry sector. Since China is short of nuclear technology in some important areas, multinationals have occupied the market with better and more funding and technology. Although the annual increase rate of patent applications remained at over 23 percent in recent years, most Chinese companies still needed to strengthen their awareness and management of intellectual property. The added value of China's exporting commodities was relatively low because of the lack of intellectual property.","{'industrialization', 'innovation', 'development', 'research'}",0.08743846563662411

Bio-engineering, which is centered on molecular biology, promises a fresh major breakthrough, which will open up a completely new prospect for agriculture, medicine and human health. Information technology is finding its way into a wide range of applied fields and evolving many new industries through integration with other sciences, technologies, economy and culture. Progress in the cognitive science, psychology and behavior science has given new impetus to the scientific and technological, educational, social and economic development. Space science has helped people deepen their understanding of the origin of the space and its evolution, providing a new panoramic picture of the structure of matters and their interaction. Geo-science has increasingly become a multi-discipline science, enabling man to acquire new capabilities in the exploration, protection and rational utilization of natural resources and ecological environment. Scientific and technological development with its overlapping, frontier and diversified nature and the ever-faster production, dissemination and application of scientific and technological knowledge have given rise to enormous socio-economic progress, promising a bright future for human civilization. The new scientific and technological revolution has presented people of all countries with precious development opportunities and also serious challenges. A country or nation would lag behind and land itself in an extremely passive position unless it closely keeps abreast with scientific and technological progress and upgrades its scientific and technological level in the light of its national development texture. In order to meet the challenge of rapid scientific and technological progress and the fast rising knowledge economy, we must keep on creating and innovating. Creativity is the soul of a nation and an inexhaustible source of a country's prosperity. The key to creation and innovation lies in human resources, whose development depends on education.

At present, national total investment in research and development only accounts for 0.5 percent of the country's GNP, Wang said, adding that, in terms of patents filed and progresses made in basic sciences, China lags behind many other countries. China's high-tech sector contributes to less than 10 percent of the country's economic growth, compared with 50 percent or so in developed countries, Wang said.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.08153386003015715

At the end of the ""Cultural Revolution,"" a dark era for the development of humanistic studies and social sciences, Deng Xiaoping, the core of the second generation of the CPC leadership, initiated a nationwide campaign to emancipate the mind.

Change(6). ― To rely on the advancement and innovation of science and technology. Technological advancement and innovation are the basis and support for tackling climate change. While promoting their own technological development and application, developed countries are obligated to promote international technological cooperation and transfer, and concretely materialize their promises to provide financial and technological support to developing countries, so that the latter can get the funds needed, apply climate-friendly technologies, and build up their capacity to decelerate and adapt to climate change. ― To rely on mass participation and extensive international cooperation. Dealing with climate change requires changes in the traditional ways of production and consumption, and the participation of the whole of society. China is working to build a resources-conserving and environmental-friendly society, foster a social atmosphere in which the enterprises and the public participate on a voluntary basis under the guidance of the government, and raise enterprises'awareness of corporate social responsibility and the public's awareness of the necessity of care for the global environment. A challenge faced by the entire world, climate change cannot be solved without global cooperation and concerted efforts. China will, as always, participate in all modes of international cooperation that are conducive to tackling climate change. China National Plan for Coping with Climate Change, released by the Chinese government in June 2007, set the following objectives to be met by 2010: Policies and measures concerning control of greenhouse gas emissions should achieve significant results, the capability of adaptation to climate change should be relentlessly enhanced, climate-change-related research should be promoted and new development should be made in scientific research related to climate change. In addition, the public awareness of the importance of tackling climate change should be enhanced, and the institutions and mechanisms for dealing with climate change should be further strengthened. Control of Greenhouse Gas Emissions ― Striving to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through accelerating the transformation of the country's economic development pattern, strengthening policy guidance concerning energy conservation and efficient utilization, intensifying administration of energy conservation in accordance with the law, speeding up development, demonstration and application of energy conservation technologies, giving full play to the role of new market-based mechanisms for energy conservation, enhancing public awareness of the importance of energy conservation, and accelerating the building of a resource-conserving society. Through these measures, the energy consumption per-unit GDP is expected to drop by about 20 percent by 2010 compared to that of 2005, and carbon dioxide emissions will consequently be reduced.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.07840605934681048

We acknowledge that the New Economy has broad potential to raise productivity, stimulate innovation in economic organization and entrepreneurship, and create and disseminate knowledge and wealth. However, the opportunities arising from these processes are not sufficiently shared among and even within economies. Hence the need to enable all individuals in our communities to benefit from them.

Capacity building constitutes a key element of the balanced approach essential to the success of APEC along with market opening and full participation. 11. In this context, we reiterate that human capacity building (HCB) remains a central theme this year and the years ahead.

The returns are in on his first four years. It's time to ask: Have we done better? The answer may depend on where you look. But on that frigid January noon in 1999 when he took the oath of office, Jeb Bush found a state with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate. Last month, it was 5.3 percent. A loss. In 1999, 12.8 percent of Floridians were in poverty; last year ended with 12.1 percent. A slight gain. The median family income in Florida when Gov. Bush took office was $35,081; today, it's $38,533. The state median income _ half of families made more, half less _ was $3,804 below the nation's at the end of 1998 and $4,519 below at the end of 2002. These standard measures suggest a Florida more inert than doing better. It seems right to look at jobs and incomes because economic development is the area of governing to which Gov. Bush's prior experience might apply. He talked more about schools during the campaign, but nothing he had done and said _ and nothing he has done in office _ inspired expectation that he had a new clue about schools. For business, though, he should have been Mr. Wisdom as a developer who briefly was secretary of commerce when Florida had one. And he surely has been active.

This included 103 billion yuan, twice the figure for the previous year, in direct subsidies to grain producers, general subsidies for agricultural production supplies, and subsidies for superior crop varieties and the purchase of agricultural machinery and tools. We significantly raised minimum grain purchase prices three times, with the total increase exceeding 20%. We implemented a temporary policy for purchasing and stockpiling major agricultural products. We intensified the protection of arable land and the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects, and increased overall agricultural production capacity. We supported the production of hogs, oilseeds and dairy products. These policies and measures played an important role in maintaining and stimulating the enthusiasm of farmers, ensuring the supply of major farm products and increasing rural incomes, and provided strong support for maintaining overall stability in economic and social development. We unswervingly promoted independent innovation and economic restructuring. We launched 16 major national science and technology projects, and established a number of new national engineering centers, key laboratories and enterprise technology centers in such fields as information technology, biotechnology and environmental protection.

XIN_ENG_20071225.0248,"Full Text: China's Energy Conditions and Policies (5). -- The scientific and technological level has been rapidly enhanced. China has scored conspicuous scientific and technological achievements relating to energy. The fundamental research findings, represented by the ""continental hydrocarbon generation theory and its application,"" have greatly promoted the development of the scientific theory of oil geology. A fairly complete system of exploration and development technologies has taken shape in the oil and gas industry, with prospecting and development techniques in geologically complicated regions and the recovery ratio of oilfields leading the world. Large coalmines of the world's advanced level have been built, and the totally mechanized mining of key coalmines has been noticeably improved. In the power industry, advanced generating technology and units with large capacity and high parameters are widely used, and the designing, engineering and equipment manufacturing of hydraulic power plants have reached the world's advanced level. China is now able to independently design and build million-kw pressurized water reactors, and has made outstanding breakthroughs in the development of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and fast-neutron-breeder reactors. The technologies to deal with pollution such as flue gas desulphurization (FGD) and renewable energy development and utilization are quickly being improved. Models of 500 kv DC and 750 kv AC electricity transmission projects have been completed and put into operation, and pilot 800 kv DC and 1,000 kv AC extra-high-voltage electricity transmission projects are under way. -- Progress has been made in environmental protection. The Chinese government sets great store by environmental protection, and has made it a fundamental state policy to strengthen environmental protection. Public awareness of environmental protection has been raised. After the 1992 UN Conference on the Environment and Development, China worked out its ""21st Century Agenda,"" and has reinforced environmental protection in an all-round way through legislative and economic means, making positive progress in this regard. China's energy policies give priority to the reduction and rehabilitation of environmental damage and pollution resulting from energy development and utilization. In 2006, coal- fueled generating units reported a nearly 100-percent installation rate of dust- cleaning facilities and a nearly 100-percent discharge of waste water up to relevant standards. The amount of smoke and dust discharged in 2006 was almost the same as that in 1980, and the dust emission per-unit electricity had decreased by 90 percent. The installation capacity of thermal power units with FGD built and put into operation in 2006 totaled 104 million kw, exceeding the combined total of the previous 10 years. Such thermal power units accounted for only 2 percent of all thermal power units in 2000, but the proportion had risen to 30 percent by 2006. -- The environment of energy market is gradually improved. The environment of China's energy market is gradually improved, and the reform in the energy industry is proceeding steadily. Breakthroughs have been made in restructuring energy enterprises, and a modern enterprise system has by and large taken shape. The investors are diversified, energy investment is growing rapidly, and the market is expanding. Market competition has been introduced into the production and distribution of coal. In the power industry, government administrative functions and enterprises' management have been separated, so has power production from power transmission, and supervisory organizations have also been established. In the oil and gas industry, the upstream and downstream sectors have been integrated, so have the domestic and international trades. Energy pricing reform has been constantly deepened, and the pricing mechanism has been improved continuously. Along with China's rapid economic development and the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, the demand for energy keeps increasing, and the construction of a stable, economical, clean and safe energy supply system faces the following challenges: -- Prominent resources restraint and low energy efficiency. China's relative dearth of high-quality energy resources hinders its supply capability; its imbalanced distribution makes it difficult to secure a continued and steady supply; and the extensive pattern of economic growth, irrational energy structure, unsatisfactory energy technology and relatively poor management have resulted in higher energy consumption per-unit GDP and for the major energy- consuming products than the average level of major energy-consuming countries, thus further intensifying the energy supply-demand contradiction. Consequently, an increase solely in supply is hard to meet the rising demand for energy.","{'industrialization', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.0703383422596517

Comrades, Having talked about the economic, political and cultural tasks, I should now like to make a special point on national defense and army building. To strengthen national defense and army building is the basic guarantee for our national security and modernization drive. Deng Xiaoping's concept of army building in the new period is the continuation and development of Mao Zedong's thinking on military affairs and the scientific guide to building our army and our national defense. In line with the general requirements of being qualified politically and competent militarily and having a fine style of work, strict discipline and adequate logistical support, we should press ahead with the army building and reform so as to make the People's Liberation Army a more revolutionary, modernized and standardized army. In our army's 70 years of brilliant history, it has stood all kinds of tests and become stronger and stronger, for which the fundamental guarantee is the strong Party leadership. Under the new historical conditions, the army must consistently uphold the absolute leadership by the Party, be in agreement with the Party Central Committee ideologically and politically, obey orders of the Party Central Committee in all actions and never forget its nature and purposes as the people's army. It should adhere to the strategy of active defense, improve its quality and take the road of fewer but better troops with Chinese characteristics. The army should be strict with itself, vigorously strengthen ideological and political work, carry forward its fine traditions and take the lead in the whole society in promoting cultural and ethical progress. In order to adapt itself to the profound changes in the military arena in the world, the army should intensify its education and training, and upgrade its defense capabilities under modern technology and especially high-tech conditions. In addition to the army reduction by one million men in the 1980s, we shall reduce the armed forces by another 500,000 in the next three years. We should strengthen the army by relying on science and technology, put more efforts in the research in defense-related science and technology, establish and improve an operation mechanism so that the defense industries are adapted to the socialist market economy, and gradually upgrade weapons and other equipment. The army should subordinate itself to and serve the overall interests of national economic development, strengthening itself through thrift and hard work and actively supporting and participating in the economic development of the country. Party organizations and governments at all levels and the masses should be concerned about and support the development of national defense and army building. We shall intensify defense education, increasing the people's awareness of the importance of national defense. The army should continue to support the government and cherish the people, and the government and the people should continue to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of armymen and martyrs so as to consolidate the unity between the army and the government and between the army and the people. We should also strengthen the work with regard to the militia and the reserves, and improve the mobilization system for national defense. We should continue to strengthen the Chinese People's Armed Police and the public and state security departments.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.06777242673916982

According to Hollywood executives involved in its establishment, MovieLabs will have a budget of more than $30 million for its first two years. The idea arose out of Hollywood's contention that the consumer electronics and information technology industries are not investing heavily or quickly enough in piracy-fighting technology. The lab is modeled after CableLabs, which since 1988 has spearheaded pivotal innovations in the cable television industry -- hastening the adoption of fiber optics, cable modems, telephony and digital video. Hollywood's version will begin with a more modest mandate, said Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America. It will focus principally on piracy prevention, though it will be given some flexibility to expand its mission later, he said.

For the last 200 years, America has been the most successful exemplar of a business-oriented culture, yielding tremendous economic benefits to its people. Yet from the days of Alexander Hamilton to the present, government and business have worked together and benefited one another economically and intellectually -- despite caricatured libertarian and communist views of American capitalism free of government intervention. Instead, business -- and America -- have prospered through successful business-government interaction. Government-funded infrastructure and research and development have helped business profit enormously, and, as the recent Bill Gates-Warren Buffett philanthropy demonstrates, business often has worked to make America and the world better. Although the United States never has had the formalized business-government (and labor) partnership that Western Europe, Japan and other Asian nations have, the two have often collaborated to ensure economic growth and national well-being.

NYT_ENG_20061219.0130,"FOR EVEN SMARTER GROWTH (FOR USE  THE BOSTON GLOBE. GOVERNOR-ELECT Deval Patrick's decision to appoint an economic development adviser to orchestrate the many agencies that touch on the state's growth recalls a similar action by Governor Romney in 2002. Judging by meager job growth over the past four years, coordination alone is no panacea for the economic challenges in Massachusetts. But a report issued Monday emphasizes the need for greater state action, especially to increase the housing supply. Patrick chose Daniel Bosley, 20-year state representative from North Adams, to coordinate the secretariats that deal with the economy, the environment, the labor force, and transportation. Romney divided up the work a bit differently: creating one office for environmental, transportation, and housing issues, and another to handle economic development and labor. Let's hope Bosley has greater longevity than Robert Pozen, who left after a year as Romney's economic affairs chief and now heads a mutual fund investment firm. Douglas Foy, the other Romney appointee, was more successful during his three years in office. Foy encouraged ""smart-growth"" policies that concentrated housing and commercial projects near public transportation to minimize harm to the environment. Romney claims this has helped triple multifamily housing starts over his four years in office. It will take longer than a governor's single term to revive an economy that has all the problems detailed in the report released Monday by the John Adams Innovation Institute, the research arm of the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative. The report finds that the state suffers from an exodus of talented workers, exorbitant housing costs, and the inability of the educational system to graduate an adequate number of people interested in scientific or technical careers. Bosley, who has been briefed on the report, says he wants to ensure that state policies are tailored to the needs of specific regions, such as job training in the Berkshires and the machine tool industry in the Pioneer Valley.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.06269294797930482

XIN_ENG_20100907.0496,"Full text of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's speech at World
Investment Forum  2010 (2). In recent years, we have worked in line with the characteristics of the different stages of opening-up, and the requirements to improve an open economic system that focuses on both domestic and international markets, that promotes win-win and mutually beneficial cooperation, and that emphasizes security and effectiveness. And we have actively summed up our successful experience in past years. We better coordinated our ""inviting in"" and ""going global"" strategies, adopted new ways of conducting overseas investment and cooperation and supported enterprises to develop international operation in research and development, production and distribution. By the end of 2009, China had set up a total of 13,000 overseas enterprises with overall assets reaching more than US$1 trillion, and had made US$245.7 billion of overseas investment in 177 countries and regions. We are stepping up efforts to facilitate various forms of overseas investment cooperation, develop our own multinational companies and support well-positioned enterprises to establish international sales distribution networks. We are working to strengthen overseas infrastructure construction cooperation, and develop overseas labor contract cooperation in a well-managed fashion. And we are actively advancing the construction of overseas economic and trade cooperation zones. Our aim is to alleviate the tensions between overcapacity and weak domestic demand, stimulate industrial transformation at home and, at the same time, promote exports of relevant products and services. In the process of building an open economy, China has worked in various forms to help developing countries enhance self- development capacity, improve the livelihood of their peoples and narrow the North-South gap. For instance, China made an additional contribution of US$50 billion to the IMF replenishment plan, making it clear that the fund should be used to support least developed countries on a priority basis; China inaugurated a China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund of US$10 billion, and provided US$15 billion of credit support to ASEAN countries, to help promote regional economic and financial stability. China provided US$10 billion of credit support to members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, US$10 billion of concessional loans to African countries, and cancelled debts owed by heavily- indebted poor countries and least developed countries in Africa; China gradually introduced zero-tariff treatment to 95% of exports from all the least developed countries with which China has diplomatic ties, and helped developing countries mitigate the impact of the international financial crisis, ease the employment pressure, and stabilize the economic situation. We will encourage more Chinese enterprises to ""go global"", and will continue to deepen South-South cooperation, and truly help developing countries raise economic development capacity. Ladies and Gentlemen, Whether in the past, at present or in the future, it is always China's long-term strategy to make good use of both domestic and global markets and resources, and promote both inbound and outbound investment. Our aim is to promote scientific and harmonious development at home and pursue peaceful and cooperation-based development with other countries. As China's open economy continues to develop, foreign investment in China will surely enjoy a broader space and generate even more profits. China is taking vigorous steps to create a more open and optimal investment environment for foreign-invested enterprises. First, we continue to foster an open and transparent legal environment.  China's socialist market economy is an economy based on the rule of law, and its investment environment is protected by laws that are open and transparent. In the thirty years and more of China's reform and opening-up, we have amended, on four occasions, the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, and in each amendment, our focus has been to further expand the scope of market access and optimize foreign investment structure. Since China's accession to the WTO in 2001, we have effectively promoted investment facilitation and transparency of the investment environment. We have steadily improved laws and regulations guiding foreign investment, increased decision-making transparency, better regulated administrative behavior, made timely information release of development programs, industrial policies, access criteria and industry developments. Recently, the Chinese government promulgated the Several Opinions of the State Council on Facilitating the Use of Foreign Investment, and introduced a series of innovative measures to optimize foreign investment utilization structure, expand areas of opening-up and diversify foreign investment utilization. To be more specific, we will encourage more foreign investment in high-end manufacturing industries, high-tech industries, modern services industries, new energy, energy-saving and environmental protection industries. We will encourage foreign investors to move to and increase investment in the central and western regions, and develop labor- intensive industries meeting environmental requirements in the central and western regions. We will encourage foreign investment to participate in the reorganization, restructuring, merger and acquisitions of Chinese enterprises in the form of equity purchase, merger and acquisition, expand channels of funding for foreign-invested enterprises in China, and give a better play to the role of foreign investment in scientific innovation, industry upgrading and balanced regional economic development.

Change (11). Developing Renewable Energy and Optimizing Energy Mix The Law on Renewable Energy and related policies were enacted in 2005 to give priority to renewable energy when transmitted on the state power grid, to purchase renewable energy at full price, to give users of renewable energy price discounts and to share the utilization of renewable energy among the whole society. A dedicated fund was created for developing renewable energy to support the evaluation and investigation of renewable energy resources, related technological research and development, construction of pilot and demonstration projects, and the development and utilization of renewable energy in the countryside. By the end of 2007, the annual installed capacity of hydropower in China was 145 million kw, generating 482.9 billion kwh of electricity, ranking first in the world in both installed capacity and power so generated. An average of 26 million kw of installed capacity was added in 2006 and 2007, with an average increase of 12 percent in each year. The scale of wind power increased several-fold. Currently, with installed capacity of more than 6 million kw, China ranks fifth in the world. In 2006 and 2007, some 3.05 million kw of installed capacity was added, an average annual increase of 148 percent. The area of solar energy collectors has reached 110 million sq m, keeping China the world leader in this field for many years. The installed power generating capacity using biomass is 3 million kw, and the annual production capacity of ethanol as biofuel is more than 1.2 million tons. The installed capacity of nuclear power is 9.06 million kw, an increase of 30.5 percent over 2006. The proportion of coal in the consumption of primary energy dropped from 72.2 percent in 1980 to 69.4 percent in 2007. The proportion of hydropower, wind power and nuclear power combined was raised from 4 percent to 7.2 percent in the same period. The total amount of renewable energy available for use is approximately 220 million tons of standard coal (including large hydropower facilities). According to the Mid- and Long-term Plan for the Development of Renewable Energy and Mid- and Long-term Plan for the Development of Nuclear Power, China will continue to promote the comprehensive cascading development of water-power-rich river valleys. It will quicken the pace of constructing large hydropower stations on the precondition that the environment is well protected and adequate relocation of the local residents is ensured. Medium and small hydropower stations will also be developed where local conditions permit. China is determined to develop rapidly more of its wind-power potential to the scale that industrialization can be achieved. It will raise its capacity for developing and manufacturing wind-power equipment and make every effort to construct several wind-power farms of one million kw and wind-power bases of 10 million kw. China will energetically push forward the development and utilization of biomass energy, with emphasis on marsh gas, and solid and liquid biofuel, and on the use of biomass to generate electricity. China will actively take advantage of solar power to generate electricity and use it for heating while strengthening the research, development and utilization of new energy and alternative energy. It will make better use of coal-bed gas and gas in mines, and develop small and scattered sources of electricity with coal-bed gas as fuel. China enthusiastically develops nuclear power, is working hard to reform the nuclear power system and spur mechanism innovation in an attempt to establish a market- oriented nuclear power development mechanism. It will strengthen its capacity for developing and manufacturing nuclear power equipment, and raise its ability to absorb imported technology and make new innovations on this basis. It will strengthen the construction of nuclear power transmission and related technical services, as well as the training of qualified personnel. It will implement preferential policies on taxation and investment that will promote the development of nuclear power, improve nuclear power safety, and quicken the enactment of laws and regulations in this field. Finally, China will push forward the use of clean coal and develop efficient and clean power generating technology, such as large-scale combined cycle units and poly-generation, and promote technology for carbon dioxide sequestration.

Bill Joy's career has been about linking people through technology, developing a key version of the Unix computer language, as well as the more recent Java and Jini languages. But perhaps nothing has created a set of connections, of leaps across boundaries, so fast, with such an amazing array of people, as his recently published ``Why the Future Doesn't Need Us'' in Wired magazine. It is Joy's lengthy, thoughtful consideration of where technology may take us, especially if we don't pay attention as developments coalesce in genetic manipulation, nanotechnology and robotics (GNR, in his parlance). Together, he argued, GNR could result in threats to the species' future even worse than the ones the world has faced from biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. He suggested we may, as a species, want to decide against pursuing some areas of research, because the potential for disaster is so great. ``Perhaps it is always hard to see the bigger impact while you are in the vortex of a change,'' Joy wrote. ``Failing to understand the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of discovery and innovation seems to be a common fault of scientists and technologists.'' In a week when publicly funded researchers in several countries and a private company finished mapping the 3.1 billion bits of DNA that comprise the human genome, the piece is worth pondering (go to www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04). Joy talks about his essential optimism about science and the future, and his growing concern that the optimism is misplaced.

Today, the island of Taiwan, thanks to the hard work and unrelenting efforts of its people, has accumulated abundant foreign reserves and high-quality R&D capabilities, as well as ample high-tech manufacturing capabilities, he said.. ""It is for these reasons that Taiwan, amid fierce international competition, has already established the prerequisites for outperforming its competitors and has won the recognition and affirmation of international public opinion,"" the president said. He cited reports by several influential international economic research institutes to showcase Taiwan's investment environment and competitiveness.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.049917786664123345

If I were magically given an hour to help Barack Obama prepare for his health care speech next week, the first thing I'd do is ask him to read David Goldhill's essay, ""How American Health Care Killed My Father,"" in the current issue of The Atlantic. That essay would lift Obama out of the distracting sideshows about this public plan or that cooperative option. It would remind him why he got into this issue in the first place. Goldhill's main message is that the American health care system is dysfunctional at the core. He vividly describes how the system hides information, muddies choices, encourages more treatment instead of better care, neglects cheap innovation, inflates costs and unintentionally increases suffering. The essay is about the real problem: the insane incentives. Goldhill is especially good on the way the voracious health care system soaks up money that could go to education, the environment, economic development and a thousand other priorities. Health care, he writes, ""simply keeps gobbling up national resources, seemingly without regard to other societal needs."" Then I'd ask Obama to go to the Brookings Institution Web site and read a report called ""Bending the Curve: Effective Steps to Address Long-Term Health Care Spending Growth.""

LTW_ENG_20060716.0004,"Live 8 Plus 1. The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: One year ago, the Group of Eight summit in Britain took place against a background of Live 8 concerts demanding greater action against poverty. The summiteers have since delivered most of what they promised on debt relief, little of what they promised on expanding foreign aid and nothing of what they promised on global trade talks. At this year's G-8 gathering in Russia this weekend, the rich world's leaders may make a last-ditch effort to revive the faltering Doha trade round. But they should also remember past promises on global health, which could use more energetic backing. One successful legacy of last year is the upgrading of global purchasing of vaccines. Traditionally, donors' willingness to buy vaccines has been hostage to shifting development fads, dampening incentives for pharmaceutical firms to invest in production facilities. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation made a start on fixing that problem by injecting $1.5 billion into a purchasing fund, enough to create steady purchasing power and to draw vaccine makers into the market. The G-8 summit built on this achievement in two ways. It called for donor governments to make long-term commitments to the purchasing fund, enabling it to plan future procurement. And it gave the purchase fund the ability to borrow in the capital markets, so that procurement could be front-loaded and irregularities in aid flows could be smoothed out. France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Britain, Brazil and South Africa have since come through with long-term commitments. The purchasing fund is expected to issue its first bonds later this year. This strengthening of incentives to manufacture vaccines must be followed by stronger incentives to develop new ones. Last year's summit aired an elegant idea to have donors commit in advance to buying certain new vaccines if private firms bring them to market. Donors would express a desire for a medical innovation -- for example, a vaccine for malaria -- and promise to buy a set number of doses at a set price, thus creating a financial carrot for pharmaceutical research establishments. In April the G-8 finance ministers resolved to test the purchase-commitment idea on the pneumococcus virus, a cause of deadly pneumonia and meningitis. But the plan needs another push from this weekend's summit in Russia, and health officials don't seem confident about getting it. It is hard to think of a worthier experiment. Unlike most aid programs, advance purchase commitments cost nothing unless they succeed. And if they do succeed -- if they accelerate the development of vaccines for pneumonia and meningitis and later for malaria and AIDS -- they will be more than worth paying for.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.04639529202261328

LTW_ENG_20070511.0006,"The Market for Ideas. The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: American patent law should provide large incentives that reward innovation. Otherwise drug companies would not have the reason or the resources to invest billions in research and development, for example. On the other hand, patents on ``innovations'' that are obvious to anyone with average skill in a field, or those that contain claims so broad they give the patentee monopoly control over huge swaths of an industry, can easily stifle invention. Take, for example, the case of an 1898 U.S. patent, eventually truncated in court, that issued exclusive rights to a single inventor for adding a gasoline engine to a car chassis -- an overly broad claim that would have resulted in giving that inventor patent rights on virtually all automobiles ever made. An important Supreme Court opinion last week intelligently relaxed America's sometimes overly restrictive patent system. Even so, legislative action is also necessary to strike a better balance between open competition and patent restriction in the United States. The court's decision relaxes the standard used to determine when patents are obvious, sensibly concluding that, in general, ``if a person of ordinary skill in the art can implement a predictable variation, and would see the benefit of doing so,'' it would not be worthy of patent protection. Rather, it would simply be ``the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.'' This is great news for software, information technology and computer hardware firms, which often have to wade through ``thickets'' of obvious or overlapping patents to develop new products. The court's opinion will also please the authors of several studies over the past few years detailing the excesses of current patent regulations. Among other things, the Federal Trade Commission in 2003 called for a more reasonable legal standard of obviousness, as did Keith E. Maskus in a report commissioned by the Council on Foreign Relations late last year. Both reports, however, also identified ways in which Congress can cautiously improve the system, many of which are included in the Patent Reform Act of 2007, which Sens. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Reps. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., and Lamar Smith, R-Texas, introduced last month. The bill would, for example, allow third parties to dispute patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office within a year of approval. This would cut down on the massive litigation costs that deter court challenges to bad patents. It would also allow interested parties to challenge the validity of patents outside of court and without first being threatened with patent infringement lawsuits.","{'information technology', 'innovation', 'action', 'development', 'research'}",0.044674907757493776

The iPhone and iPod reversed the fortunes of a company that nearly sank in the 1990s, when the future of computing seemed to lie in nondescript PCs built to order via the Internet. In this decade, led by CEO/guru Steve Jobs, Apple targeted consumers instead of corporate IT managers, packed vast computing power into tiny devices, and opened the door to countless little applications that help users find recipes and navigate the MBTA. An idealist like Clarke might wish that some fraction of that effort had gone toward curing cancer, say, or exploring the stars. In his vision of the first decade of the 21st century, a series of huge black monoliths - placed by some alien intelligence - led mankind to the outer solar system. When Clarke died last year, black monoliths were indeed beckoning to humanity, but they were pocket-size.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.043663901322762856
XIN_ENG_20101007.0282,"Premier's speech at the Sixth China-EU Business Summit (Part II). The following is the full text of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's keynote speech delivered at the Sixth China-European Union Business Summit here on Wednesday: (continued from Part I) The second question is whether the investment environment in China is good or not. I would like to tell you that China will steadfastly push forward its reform and opening-up process and will in no way deviate from the path. Only through reform and opening to the outside world will China develop further. The basic policies that have been established in the reform and opening-up drive will not be changed. The only changes that have taken place are that foreign investment is now under better and more orderly regulation. Entrepreneurs' concern for the investment environment does not go beyond three aspects -- intellectual property, innovation and government procurement. I can tell you in a responsible manner that all foreign businesses that are legally registered in China are entitled to enjoy national treatment, and that all products made by foreign-invested enterprises in China are made-in-China products. We will protect not only your intellectual property, but also all your legitimate rights and interests. The third question regards the export of raw materials, specifically the export of rare earth. As a long-time researcher on rare earth metals, I have a say on the issue. There are two kinds of rare earth metals, the heavy rare earth elements and the light rare earth elements. China has rare earth deposits in different regions, with the heavy ones located mainly in the south, such as Jiangxi Province. The light ones are mainly in the north, such as Baotou City in Inner Mongolia. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a lack of well-regulated management over rare earth metals in China, and also a lack of extraction technologies in the country. Some countries bought a large amount of rare earth metals from China at low prices in a period of time when management over rare earth in China was the most chaotic, and even now they still have a considerable stockpile, which they know very well. China contributes a large proportion of the global rare earth output, which far outdoes its share of the world's total rare earth deposits. We haven't imposed, and will not, impose an embargo on the industry. We are pursuing a sustainable development of the rare earth industry, not only to meet the demand of our own country, but also to cater to the needs of the whole world. We not only need to accommodate the current demand, but also, more significantly, need to take a long-term perspective. It is necessary to exercise management and control over the rare earth industry, but there won't be any embargo. China is not using rare earth as a bargaining chip. We aim for the world's sustainable development.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.04325823950724722
LTW_ENG_20040601.0003,"Boeing Bets on Dreamliner. Boeing Co. is pitching its new 7E7 commercial jet as a dream aircraft for both passengers and airlines. Enlarged windows will offer wide views of the horizon. Improved cabin pressurization will minimize dry eyes and skin. Travelers will have more space for carry-ons in overhead bins. Boeing promises airlines that they will appreciate innovations in design and technology that will reduce operating costs when the jet begins commercial flights in 2008. But the real measure of the Dreamliner will be whether it can revive the sagging reputation and fortunes of the world's once-dominant airplane maker, industry analysts say. ``We went all over the planet to understand what's wrong with the travel experience,'' said Klaus Brauer, director of Boeing passenger satisfaction and revenue. ``If you can make people more comfortable without increasing airlines' cost, it's the holy grail.'' The 7E7 is Boeing's bet on the future of air travel. The aircraft, which will seat at most 289 passengers, is aimed at carriers flying point-to-point international flights. Boeing says its research indicates mid-size aircraft with direct service will dominate the new-aircraft market in the next two decades. Its vision contrasts sharply with that of its arch rival Airbus SAS, now the leading commercial jet maker. Airbus has been touting its development of the world's largest passenger jet, the 555-seat A380. The European company is betting airlines will want enormous planes for long-haul flights to major-city hubs.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.04324211234039023

Japan's ruling coalition parties unveiled a package of tax reform proposals for fiscal 2003 on Friday, which features tax breaks for companies to boost the economy and tax hikes on tobacco and liquor to help shore up the nation's dismal finances. The package, which caps yearlong talks on tax reforms, was adopted by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the New Komeito party and the New Conservative Party in an evening meeting. In response to Koizumi's calls to carry out tax cuts of more than a net one trillion yen (8.2 billion US dollars), the package proposes tax reductions of 2 trillion yen (16.4 billion dollars) and tax hikes of 200 billion yen (1.6 billion dollars) for fiscal 2003, bringing net tax cuts to 1.8 trillion yen (14.7 billion dollars) for the next fiscal year.

NYT_ENG_19951116.0227,"`LUCK': A COUNTRY HOOKED ON LUCKING OUT. Such is the attraction of luck in our lives that a book called ``Luck: The Brilliant Randomness of Everyday Life'' sounds appealing from its title alone. Yet Nicholas Rescher, a philosophy professor at the University of Pittsburgh, reminds us here that much more is needed for a good book than luck. With his wordily prosaic style and his meandering organization, he unluckily succeeds in making the subject of luck dull. Or is it that luck matters so much that little about it remains to be explored? Certainly we already know, as Rescher reminds us, that ``Success or failure in situations of competition and conflict often hinges on matters of fortuitous happenstance.'' Or that ``There is enormous scope for luck in warfare.'' Eventually, Rescher does wend his way to the slightly less obvious conclusion that life without luck would be unbearable for humans. ``Our psychological and emotional condition is such that we would not want to live in a preprogrammed world, a world where the rest of our fate and future is preordained and indeed prediscernible in the realities of the present,'' he writes. ``Even at the price of falling victim to chance and haphazard, we yearn for novelty and innovation, for a liberation from an inevitability programmed by the settled determination of the past.'' Yet such is the power of his prose to snuff out the promise of surprise that one finds it a struggle to remain awake long enough to arrive at this conclusion. Further pitfalls of luck become evident in Robert Goodman's new book, ``The Luck Business: The Devastating Consequences and Broken Promises of America's Gambling Explosion.'' Goodman, who teaches environmental design and planning at Hampshire College, was director of the U.S. Gambling Study, and the results of that survey of legalized gambling as a strategy for economic development inform his well-reasoned book.","{'innovation', 'development', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.042254229754465134

Some regions of the EU are still suffering from shortages of skilled workers, not least in the information and communications technology sector, and the situation looks likely to get worse unless the EU works harder towards an integrated labor force, according to a report issued Tuesday by the European Commission (EC). The report, ""Towards an Integrated Employment Market -- the Contribution of EURES"", provides an overview of the functioning of the European Employment Service (EURES) network for the period 2000-2001. The commission's report admits that there is still a qualifications shortfall at EU level. Employment growth in sectors such as information technology, teaching and health care requiring highly skilled workers was 3 percent a year in the EU between 1995 and 2000, compared with only 1 percent in other sectors. The gap between supply and demand of skilled workers looks likely to widen if the EU meets its self-endowed target of investing 3 percent of GDP in research and development by 2010. And in the information and communications technology sector, this gap between demand and supply is predicted to reach 1.6 million jobs in the EU next year, says the report. The report also points to the serious imbalance between some regions with high unemployment levels and others (like the South of England, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands) with high employment that currently face large shortages of skilled manpower, saying that EU must have a skilled and adaptable labor force.","{'communications technology', 'development', 'information technology', 'research'}",0.04092631777673158
XIN_ENG_20071225.0253,"Full Text: China's Energy Conditions and Policies (9). To promote all-round energy conservation, China will take the following measures: -- Pushing forward structural adjustment. The major reasons for low efficiency of energy utilization for a long time have been the extensive mode of economic growth and a high proportion of high energy-consuming industries in China. The country will put the transformation of the development pattern and the adjustment of the industrial structure and of the internal structures of industries in the key place for the energy-conservation strategy, and work hard to bring into being a pattern of economic development with ""low input, low consumption, less emission and high efficiency."" China will accelerate the optimization and upgrading of its industrial structure, make energetic efforts to develop high- and new-tech industries and the service trades, set strict limits on the development of high energy-, material- and water-consuming industries, and eliminate industries with backward productivity, so as to fundamentally change the pattern of economic development and put in place an energy-saving industrial system on an early date. -- Improving energy conservation in industry. Industry is a major sector of energy consumption in China. The country is determined to take a new road to industrialization characterized by high scientific and technological content, good economic returns, low resource consumption, minimum of environmental pollution, and full use of human resources. To achieve this, China will accelerate the development of high-tech industries and transform traditional industries with high- and new-technologies, as well as advanced and applicable ones, and in turn upgrade the overall industrial standard. Industries with high energy consumption, such as steel, nonferrous metals, coal, electricity, petroleum and petrochemicals, chemical engineering and building materials, will be the target sectors for saving energy and reducing energy consumption. The Chinese government has launched an energy-conservation drive among 1,000 enterprises, with the focus on tightening control over those consuming 10,000 tons of standard coal or more each year. It will readjust the product mix, speed up technological reform, improve management and economize on energy. It will support a group of key and demonstration projects aiming to conserve energy and cut consumption so as to rally industries to enhance their energy-saving level. It will continue to raise the standards for energy efficiency of industry, eliminate backward and high energy-consuming products, and perfect the market access system. -- Launching energy-saving projects. China is carrying out ten key energy-saving projects, including petroleum substitution, simultaneous generation of heat and power, surplus heat utilization and the construction of energy-saving buildings. The Chinese government supports key and demonstration energy-saving projects, and encourages extensive application of high-efficiency, energy-saving products. China will make vigorous efforts to construct energy- and land-saving buildings, actively promote the energy-saving renovation of existing buildings, and extensively use new walling materials. China will continue to implement petroleum substitution and develop substitute fuels in a scientific way. It will speed up the elimination of old automobiles and ships, actively develop public transport; set limits on high oil-consuming automobiles, and develop energy- saving and environment-friendly automobiles. It will accelerate the innovation of coal-fueled industrial boilers (kilns), regional simultaneous generation of heat and power and surplus heat and pressure utilization, and improve the efficiency of energy utilization. It will save more energy in the sphere of electrical machinery and optimize energy systems, so as to improve the efficiency of both. It will carry out the Green Lighting Project, and spread more rapidly high-performance electrical appliances. It will also spread technologies for firewood- and coal-saving stoves and energy-saving houses in rural areas, and eliminate old, high energy-consuming farm machinery and fishing boats, so as to promote energy conservation in agriculture and the rural areas. It will urge government bodies to save more energy, giving full play to the role of the government in leading energy conservation. It will put in place at an early date the system of energy-conservation monitoring and technological support, strengthening energy-conservation monitoring and establishing new energy services platforms.

LTW_ENG_19960813.0100,"Japan Holds Record in Life Expectancy. Japan, which at the turn of the century had mortality rates higher than most other industrialized nations, today has the highest life expectancy of any country, researchers recently reported. The study by actuaries Bruce D. Schobel and Robert J. Myers found that Japanese mortality rates were still relatively high until the 1950s, when they began to decrease rapidly. By 1990, Japanese life expectancy had outdistanced the long-time leaders Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The current life expectancy at birth for a Japanese man is 75.9 years and 81.9 years for a woman. The study was based on official life tables from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. Schobel, corporate vice president and actuary at New York Life Insurance Co., and Myers, retired chief actuary of the U.S. Social Security Administration, said their analysis was limited to what occurred in Japan, not why it occurred. ``We do not know all the steps that Japan has taken to accomplish so much in this area,'' they wrote in the study, which was published last month in Transactions, Society of Actuaries 1993-1994 Reports. ``In fact, the Japanese themselves cannot attribute all the observed declines in mortality directly to specific actions.'' Still, they said, there are some clues: easy access to high-quality medical care, a traditional low-fat diet and Japan's economic development that has led to a high standard of living. ``High living standards are ordinarily associated with low mortality,'' the authors wrote. ``Americans may be able to learn much more from the Japanese experience and apply those lessons here.''","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.04037187524357971

XIN_ENG_20090315.0232,"Full Text: Report on China's central, local budgets (11). We must focus on the following five areas in following a proactive fiscal policy: One is to expand government spending while striving to focus on key areas. This is an important measure for boosting domestic consumption and maintaining steady and rapid economic development. In addition to increasing its public spending by 104 billion yuan at the end of 2008 to develop low-income housing and support post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction, the central government in 2009 will allocate 908 billion yuan in public spending, an increase of 487.5 billion yuan. This includes 208.1 billion yuan to develop agricultural infrastructure and improve the wellbeing of rural residents, 49.3 billion yuan to develop low- income housing, 71.3 billion yuan to finance education, medical and health care and other social programs, 130 billion yuan for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction, 68 billion yuan for energy conservation, emissions reduction and ecological conservation, 45.2 billion yuan to make independent innovation and technological upgrading in enterprises and develop service industries, and 231.7 billion yuan to develop infrastructure such as railways, highways, airports and ports. Two is to carry out reform of taxes and fees and implement structural tax reductions. While carrying out reform and improving the taxation system, we will implement structural tax reductions to lighten the tax load on enterprises and the people, encourage enterprises to increase their investment and boost consumer spending power. We need to fully implement a consumption VAT, reduce the tax load on enterprises and encourage them to increase spending on independent innovation and technological upgrading. We will carry out reform of taxes and fees for refined petroleum products, make the distribution of the tax and fee load fairer and promote energy conservation and emissions reduction. We will rescind and cease collecting 100 items of administrative fees. We will continue to carry out a series of policies for tax and fee reduction or elimination that were introduced in 2008 to increase the salary threshold for the individual income tax, raise the export tax rebate rates for some products, eliminate or reduce customs tariffs for some exports, reduce the securities transaction stamp tax rate, scrap the stamp tax on stock purchases, suspend the individual income taxes on interest earnings from savings and stock account balance, and reduce taxes on home sales. This should reduce the load on enterprises and individuals by about 500 billion yuan in 2009. Three is to increase the income of the low-income population and strongly promote consumption demand. We will adjust the distribution of national wealth and increase the proportion of individual incomes in national income distribution and the proportion of the primary distribution of income that goes directly to wages and salaries to increase the consumption capacity of residents and strengthen the effect consumption has in promoting economic growth. We need to give full play to the role of fiscal and taxation policies and increase the government assistance, focusing on increasing the income of the low- and middle- income population. We will further increase subsidies to farmers. The central budget for 2009 earmarks 123.08 billion yuan for direct subsidies to grain producers, general subsidies for purchasing agricultural supplies, subsidies for growing superior crop varieties and subsidies for the purchase of agricultural machinery and tools, an increase of 20.04 billion yuan or 19.4%. In addition, we will support a large increase in the minimum purchase price for grain in order to increase rural incomes. We will also allocate 220.833 billion yuan to increase subsistence allowances for both urban and rural families, grant them and other families in financial hardship a one-time subsidy before Spring Festival, increase basic pension payments for retirees from state-owned enterprises and increase support for entitled groups. We will carry out reform of the income distribution system in institutions. In addition, we will increase government spending to encourage and guide consumer demand. We will allocate 103.341 billion yuan to implement a policy subsidizing rural residents' purchase of home appliances and vehicles and increase reserves of important materials such as grain, petroleum, nonferrous metals and specialty steel products. Four is to improve the structure of budgetary expenditures and maintain and improve the people's wellbeing. We will support rural reform and development. The central government will allocate 716.14 billion yuan, an increase of 120.59 billion yuan or 20.2%, to assist agriculture, rural areas and farmers. We will focus on efforts to maintain and improve the people's wellbeing. The central government will allocate 728.463 billion yuan, an increase of 165.334 billion yuan or 29.4% in comparable terms, for education, medical and health care, the social safety net, employment, low-income housing and culture that are directly related to the people's wellbeing.

Intel Corp. said Tuesday it would cut 10,500 jobs -- more than 10 percent of its workforce -- by the middle of next year as the Silicon Valley heavyweight trims up to fight smaller, nimbler rivals. The cuts accelerate the company's most significant restructuring in two decades and are intended to refocus Intel on its primary business of making computer chips. As Intel diversified in recent years into new products, it saw its core market eroded by rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said the company expects to reduce operating costs by $2 billion in 2007 and by $3 billion in 2008. Despite the job reductions -- aimed primarily at management, marketing and information technology positions -- Intel will have about 10,000 more workers than it did at the end of 2003, when the company rapidly ramped up hiring. ``These actions, while difficult, are essential to Intel becoming a more agile and efficient company, not just for this year or the next, but for years to come,'' Otellini said in a statement. Intel executives declined to comment further on the restructuring or to forecast how the changes might affect third-quarter earnings. With the restructuring, analysts said, the Santa Clara, Calif., company made its biggest concession yet that the well-known ``Intel Inside'' marketing slogan can only take it so far in fending off competition.

But in their search to discover which countries are happier than others and why, these scholars -- led by University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart -- have stumbled on one pretty fundamental conclusion about what people want out of life: freedom. Yes, that's right, more or less the same thing you were celebrating Friday by scarfing down hamburgers next to the pool in your brother-in-law's backyard. How exactly, you ask, is gay marriage connected with ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""? It's simple. According to surveys, in developed countries discrimination against women and minorities is actually waning and gays remain the least tolerated ""outgroup"" in society. They are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine. In most developed countries, the relative level of their acceptance or rejection is a  sensitive indicator of that society's overall tolerance toward minorities. And -- here's the takeaway -- social tolerance ""broadens the range of choices available to people,"" thereby enhancing happiness for both the tolerant and the intolerant alike. Sounds a little too touchy-feely, right? Are they saying that Armenians, who were next to last in the study's happiness ranking, should immediately allow gays to marry in order to be happier?  Not exactly. The researchers have found that freedom of choice is not only a universal aspiration but the single most important basis of human happiness. But to get to freedom of choice for Armenians, who live in poverty, social tolerance might not beat out economic development on the national ""to-do"" list. That's because first, you have to have  enough food to eat.  Of course,  economic well-being doesn't just buy food, it also frees people from the lack of life choices that deprivation imposes -- suddenly you're on your way up the happiness scale.","{'well-being', 'development', 'research', 'economic development'}",0.038387144704135075

XIN_ENG_19990322.0096,"hke032253 - Malaysia Expects Intellectual Property Market to Grow. A completely new market is predicted to emerge for commercial buying and selling of made-in- Malaysia intellectual property worth over 1 billion ringgit (263.157 million U.S. dollars) by 2001. Making the prediction, Henry Goh, the newly-elected president of the Malaysian chapter of the Licensing, Executives Society (LES), the world's largest intellectual property society, said Monday that this is achievable since Malaysian information technology companies now comprise more than 67 percent of the 205 companies granted with the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) status. As 139 Malaysian and joint-venture MSC companies begin to realize the fruits of their research and development in information technology and biotechnology, they would be in a position to sell or license their know-hows in the international markets, said Henry Goh said in a statement. ""Based just on the current 139 Malaysian MSC companies and their success in spawning home-grown innovations, the licensing value of made-in-Malaysia intellectual property will surpass 1 billion ringgit within the next two years,"" he said. The number of Malaysian knowledge workers at MSC companies jumped from 2,706 in October 1997 to 9,163 this month, showing that the MSC would develop even faster as the economy recovers, according to Goh, who is also president of Henry Goh &AMP; Co Sdn Bhd, an intellectual property consultancy firm.","{'innovation', 'development', 'information technology', 'research'}",0.03740083284074555

XIN_ENG_20100925.0201,"Full Text: Progress in China's Human Rights in 2009 (6). Judicial transparency has increased. In 2009 the Supreme People's Court issued the Six Provisions on Judicial Openness, which applies the principle of openness to every procedure of trial and law enforcement, improves the regulations on the release of judgment documents on the Internet and live broadcast of court hearings, requires openness of the judicial process and results, adopts a regular press-release system, and expands the scope and depth of judicial openness. In the same year, the Supreme People's Court enacted the Disciplinary Regulations for Staff Members of People's Courts. On the basis of this ordinance, 795 staff members of people's courts at all levels were investigated and punished for breaches of law or discipline. Among them, 137 were transferred to judicial organs for investigation. A total of 303,000 letters voicing grievances from ordinary people were addressed by the courts and 1,055,000 complainants were received. The legal aid system has achieved remarkable results, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of people with financial difficulties. In June 2009 the Ministry of Justice organized activities with the theme  ""Legal aid services for the convenience of the people,""  and promoted ten measures nationwide to help ordinary people with legal affairs. The coverage of legal aid has been expanded throughout the country, and issues including health care, employment, education, work remuneration and social security which are closely related to the people's well-being have been incorporated as supplements into the coverage of legal aid for the protection of citizens' rights and interests. More and more regions in China have adjusted the ""financial difficulty level"" to 1.5 to 2 times the minimum living standard of the region in question so that more people with financial difficulties can enjoy the benefit of legal aid. The legal aid network is being continuously consolidated. By the end of 2009 some 3,274 legal aid organizations and 58,031 legal aid service centers had been set up at the provincial, city and county levels nationwide, providing convenient access to legal aid services. In 2009, over 640,000 legal aid cases were handled, and legal consultancy services were extended to 4.84 million people, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of people with financial difficulties. The role of lawyers in protecting human rights through judicial means has been increasingly strengthened. In 2009 China formulated regulations and rules in this respect, specifying relevant stipulations in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Lawyers. These detailed regulations facilitate the implementation of stipulations in the Law on lawyers' rights to consult with clients, to read case records, and to investigate and collect evidence, advancing the development of litigation on the part of lawyers and creating a strong legal guarantee for lawyers to carry out their responsibilities and play a larger role in judicial procedures. In 2009 lawyers throughout the country undertook over 1.96 million litigation cases of all types, effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of their clients and promoting judicial justice. The legal rights and interests of people in detention and prison are protected by law. In 2009 the Ministry of Justice enacted and implemented the Assessment Measures for the Work on the Rehabilitation of Criminals in Prison to popularize the performance assessment system of rehabilitation work in an all- round way. It also carried out a campaign focusing on ""regulating law enforcement actions and raising the level of law enforcement"" in an attempt to solve the problems in law enforcement. A rehabilitation mode of ""5+1+1,"" namely five days of rehabilitation through labor and one day of classroom education, plus one day of rest every week has been widely adopted in prisons. Measures have been taken to ensure that prisoners' standard of living and health care levels always keep up with the country's social and economic development. In 2009 the procuratorial organs urged the correction of the excessive detention of 337 people, and put forward rectification opinions on 22,268 cases of unlawful actions. In the same year the procuratorial organs joined hands with the public security organs in launching a special inspection of supervision and law enforcement at detention houses throughout China. This campaign discovered and punished 2,207 prisoners who bullied other inmates, and 123 of them were prosecuted for their acts involving criminal offences. The procuratorial organs and the Ministry of Justice jointly carried out a campaign to ""check for possible hidden dangers of accidents and improve the safety of detention houses and prisons.""  As a result improvement was made in safety measures and supervision work in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of criminals. Meanwhile, the people's mediation system has been strengthened. By the end of 2009 a total of 823,000 people's mediation committees with 4,938,000 mediators from among ordinary people had been established throughout China. In 2009 these committees mediated 7,676,000 disputes, prevented 48,000 civil disputes from escalating into criminal cases, and stopped 18,000 people from committing suicide in civil dispute cases.

NYT_ENG_20070715.0038,"A PATENT IS WORTH HAVING, RIGHT? WELL, MAYBE NOT. Patents are supposed to give inventors an incentive to create things that spur economic growth. For some companies, especially in the pharmaceutical business, patents do just that by allowing them to pull in billions in profits from brand-name, blockbuster drugs. But for most public companies, patents don't pay off, say a couple of researchers who have crunched the numbers. ""Today, overall, patents don't work; for the information technology industry especially, they don't work,"" said James Bessen, who became a lecturer at Boston University's law school after a career in business. In 1983, he created the first computer publishing software with Wysiwyg (an acronym for ""what you see is what you get"") printing abilities. He also founded a desktop publishing company, Bestinfo, later acquired by Intergraph. Neither Bessen nor his company patented anything, in part because his lawyers told him that software couldn't be patented at the time. He ultimately became interested in whether patents spurred innovation, since the software industry for years innovated steadily without using many patents. He and a colleague, Michael J. Meurer, are readying a book on the topic, ""Do Patents Work?,"" due in 2008. (A synopsis and sample chapters are at researchoninnovation.org/dopatentswork/.) The two researchers have analyzed data from 1976 to 1999, the most recent year with complete data. They found that starting in the late 1990s, publicly traded companies saw patent litigation costs outstrip patent profits. Specifically, they estimate that about $8.4 billion in global profits came directly from patents held by publicly traded U.S. companies in 1997, rising to about $9.3 billion in 1999, with two-thirds of the profits going to chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Domestic litigation costs alone, meanwhile, soared to $16 billion in 1999 from $8 billion in 1997. Things have probably become worse since then. For instance, patent litigation is up: There were 2,318 patent-related suits in 1999, and 2,830 in fiscal 2006 (though that's down from the peak year, 2004, when 3,075 were filed). Bessen said awards in patent cases also seemed to be up, though he was less confident in that data. Worse, he says, companies doing the most research and development are sued the most.","{'innovation', 'development', 'information technology', 'research'}",0.03611291819890502

NYT_ENG_20000629.0226,"Girls are GEEKS too!. It takes a woman to tell this story, a woman who was once a mid-teenager too old to play with dolls but not quite old enough to drive. A woman who can relate to the inner workings of a 15-year-old girl whose physical composition is 85 percent gangly limbs, 10 percent braces and 5 percent stuff that's just starting to make sense. A woman who would not be put off by a girl who uses the word ``like'' 37 times in each of her tediously unforgiving run-on sentences. A woman who would not be annoyed by a girl with an earsplitting guffaw-screech-snort that follows every one of her best friend's only mildly funny comments. It takes a woman to tell this story simply because she was this very kind of girl at one point. And unlike teen-age boys _ whose interests seem to oscillate timelessly between cars and the sex-symbols of the era _ her well-being hinged on her capacity for optimally uninhibited and uninterrupted communication. One wonders what girls did before His Highness, Alexander Graham Bell, contrived the blessed device that allowed for anytime conferencing about fashion faux pas, cute teachers or the coordination of the same kind of sandwich in tomorrow's lunch boxes. The teen girl's telephone was as sacred and essential a prop as a Christian's cross or a judge's gavel. Given the chance, teen girls might have single-fingeredly dialed the contraption up as the most influential invention of all time. But then along came ``Dad's'' computer; a big, clunky, unimpressive machine that helped fathers with their work; a machine toward which brothers and sons seemed to naturally gravitate _ clear-cut signs that it was nothing of value to her. Who knew that it would eventually reshape human interaction on such a global scale? Chances are, men didn't even realize its potential at the time, but their early appreciation for the computer and its offerings gave them an impressive head start. Women's uphill battle of playing technological catch-up at times seems futile, at other times absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, recent years have seen a slew of female leaders who are determined to get girls thinking beyond the wonders of the telephone by tapping into the double-X chromosomers and their computers _ that market just waiting to be tapped. One such leader, Laura Groppe, president and chief executive officer of Girl Games, Inc. _ a local research and product development company that focuses on girls ages 8 to 18 _ is using activities like focus groups and slumber parties to fill the technological gap that still exists between boys and girls, all in an effort to help realize her vision of living in a world where women rival and often surpass men in areas of technology awareness.","{'development', 'research', 'action', 'well-being'}",0.034532230469576944

LTW_ENG_20090630.0077,"REHABILITATING HEALTH CARE: Controlling costs. Alarmed by increases in health-care costs, policymakers and insurers have adopted a series of reforms over the years -- such as price controls and HMOs -- whose savings proved to be temporary at best. With that history in mind, some experts say that the only sure way to control the growth in health-care spending is for the government to cap it, a cure that would be worse than the disease. There may be no quick fix, but there certainly are ways to deliver and pay for health care that can give consumers more value for their money. If we undertake them now, the eventual result will be a higher-quality system that's more sustainable and affordable. The cost problem has multiple causes, but a primary one is the overuse of medical services and technology. Today's health insurance system gives physicians and hospitals little incentive to practice medicine cost-effectively. And as long as they can pass their costs on to consumers in the form of ever-rising premiums, insurance companies don't need to be disciplined spenders either. To create the right incentives, insurers should move away from paying for each treatment or service performed for a patient -- an approach that rewards volume, not effectiveness -- and instead base reimbursements on the treatment plans that produce the best results. It's a fundamental shift that would  take years to implement, in part because of the work health-care providers must do to create and maintain treatment guidelines for doctors and hospitals. To help advance the process, Congress included $1.1 billion  in the economic stimulus bill in February for research that compares the effectiveness of different treatments. There's much that remains unknown about how best to treat various illnesses and injuries, and each new drug or device that's developed raises new questions about effectiveness. There are significant issues too about how to enforce such guidelines.  But the development of ""best practices"" could help doctors by providing a shield against malpractice claims, reducing the incidence of wasteful tests and other ""defensive"" procedures. Another needed improvement would be to simplify the interaction between doctors and insurers. A recent study  in Health Affairs magazine reported that for every three full-time physicians, two employees were needed to handle the billing and insurance paperwork. That's an outrageous administrative burden that diverts money from delivering care. Doctors and hospitals, meanwhile, must update the way they collect, store and share information about patients and treatments. Computerizing medical records and integrating information technology into patient care promise to improve care and cut costs by eliminating duplication, averting errors and better monitoring chronic ailments, among other benefits. Congress promoted the effort with about $20 billion in subsidies for electronic medical records in the stimulus bill. But it's an expensive and time-consuming process -- one estimate  put the total cost at $150 billion -- and especially daunting for primary-care doctors in small p! ractices.","{'information technology', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.033228576080298125

Change (12). Developing a Recycling Economy to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions Attaching great importance to developing a recycling economy, the Chinese government is doing its best to reduce the amount of resources consumed, and reuse and recycle items so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their sources and in the course of production. In recent years, a recycling economy is turning from an idea to action, and developing rapidly across the country. The state has enacted laws and regulations such as the Clean Production Promotion Law, Law on the Prevention of Environmental Pollution by Solid Wastes, Law on a Recycling Economy and Methods on Management of Urban Garbage. It has promulgated the Opinions on Accelerating the Development of a Recycling Economy, setting forth the general strategy, short-term goals, basic means, and policies and measures for the development of a recycling economy. It has also promulgated an evaluation index system for a recycling economy. In addition, the Regulations Regarding the Management of the Recycling and Treatment of Discarded Electrical Equipment is to be promulgated soon. Two batches of demonstration pilot projects have been carried out, resulting in a recycling economy development model at three levels, i.e., enterprises, between enterprises or industrial parks, and in society in general. Pilot projects featuring recycling and treatment of old and useless household electrical appliances and remanufacturing of automobile parts have made satisfactory progress. Preferential policies concerning taxation on the comprehensive utilization of disposables and the recycling and utilization of renewable energy have been improved. More support is being given to key projects in the recycling economy by treasury bonds and investment within the central budget. Through importation, absorption, digestion and self-innovation, some advanced technologies with proprietary intellectual property rights have emerged, in particular, a group of key technologies which play a leading role in respective sectors have been developed, demonstrated and popularized. Applicable technologies, such as low-temperature power generation by waste heat, coke dry- quenching, power generation by differential pressure at blast furnace top, cement produced using calcium carbide slag in the drying process, and disposal of garbage in blast furnaces and rotary kilns, are now widely used. In 2005, nearly one third of the raw materials for China's steel, nonferrous metals and pulp industries came from renewable resources, while 20 percent of the raw materials for cement and 40 percent of the raw materials for walls came from industrial solid waste. Marked progress has been made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the production of semiconductors, including sealing and packaging. The level of greenhouse gas emissions during the making of electronic information products remains low. The state has formulated policies that encourage the recycling and utilization of landfill gas, and has promulgated industrial standards such as the Policies on Technologies for the Treatment of Urban Garbage and Pollution Prevention, and Technical Standards on Sanitary Landfill of Garbage, which promote the retrieval and utilization of landfill gas and reduction of emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, China is carrying out research into and popularizing advanced technologies for garbage burning and recycling, and utilization of landfill gas. Relevant technological standards are being promulgated, and the garbage collection and transportation system is being improved. Garbage classification has begun in some areas; comprehensive utilization of garbage as a resource has been raised to promote the industrialization of the treatment of garbage. Supervision is being tightened on enterprises engaged in garbage treatment. As a result, the detoxification rate of garbage was raised from 2.3 percent in 1990 to 52 percent in 2006.

XIN_ENG_20100608.0428,"Full Text: The Internet in China (9). China advocates the rational use of technology to curb dissemination of illegal information online. Based on the characteristics of the Internet and considering the actual requirements of effective administering of the Internet, it advocates the exertion of technical means, in line with relevant laws and regulations and with reference to common international practices, to prevent and curb the harmful effects of illegal information on state security, public interests and minors. The Decision of the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Guarding Internet Security, Regulations on Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China, Measures on the Administration of Internet Information Services, Measures on the Administration of Security Protection of the International Networking of Computer Information Networks, and other laws and regulations clearly prohibit the spread of information that contains contents subverting state power, undermining national unity, infringing upon national honor and interests, inciting ethnic hatred and secession, advocating heresy, pornography, violence, terror and other information that infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of others. According to these regulations, basic telecommunication business operators and Internet information service providers shall establish Internet security management systems and utilize technical measures to prevent the transmission of all types of illegal information. The state advocates strengthening Internet legal and ethical education. The level of legal and ethical education of the whole society is closely connected with the construction of the Internet environment. It supports the work of Internet legal and ethical education, encourages the active participation by various media and social organizations, and proactively pushes forward the inclusion of Internet legal and ethical education in the curriculums of primary and middle schools. It attaches great importance to youth and women's organizations in their roles of elevating national network morals, and encourages relevant organizations to carry out activities for the public good to spread Internet knowledge and promote the correct use of the Internet. The state guarantees online safety for minors. Minors have become China's biggest online group. By the end of 2009, a third of the country's 384 million Internet users were minors. The Internet is playing an increasingly important role in the development of minors. Meanwhile, online pornographic, illegal and harmful information is seriously damaging the physical and psychological health of young people, and this has become recognized as a prominent issue of public concern. The Chinese government attaches great importance to online safety for minors, and has always prioritized the protection of minors in the overall work of Internet information security programs. The Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Minors stipulates that the state shall take measures to prevent minors from overindulging in the Internet; prohibit any organization or individual from producing, selling, renting or providing by other means electronic publications and Internet information containing pornography, violence, murder, terror, gambling or other contents harmful to minors. The state encourages research and development of Internet tools that are conducive to the online protection of minors, as well as Internet products and services suitable for minors. Families, schools and all other social units shall work together to protect minors online and create a healthy online environment for the development of minors. The Chinese government will actively push forward the ""Mothers' Education Program"" to help parents guide their children in using the Internet correctly. The state proactively protects digital intellectual property. Since 2000 China has revised the Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated the Measures for the Administrative Protection of Internet Copyright and offered relevant judicial interpretations for the trial of cases involving computer and network copyrights disputes, thus providing a legal basis for digital intellectual property protection. The state copyright administrative department is in charge of the investigation and punishment of Internet copyright infringement and pirating activities. To combat repeated copyright infringement, group infringement and large-scale pirating activities, relevant government organs have taken a series of administrative actions. China will continue to explore intellectual property protection work in the Internet environment, and strive to realize a balance between public interest protection and the promotion of innovation.

XIN_ENG_20090315.0224,"Full Text: Report on China's central, local budgets (3). Following is an overview of budget implementation and financial work in 2008: 1. Budgetary revenue growth and use of surplus revenue Thanks to intensified efforts in revenue collection and management by tax, customs and public finance departments in addition to economic development, overall revenue growth was fairly rapid, though growth in the second half of the year was noticeably more sluggish. Thanks to rapid economic growth and good corporate performance in the first half of the year, plus special factors such as the 2007 surge in corporate profits, increase in corporate income tax receipts and the effect of tax policy adjustments, national revenue grew by 33.3%. None of these special factors were present in the second half of the year. Due mainly to the impact of the global financial crisis, economic growth slowed and corporate profits weakened. Following a big cut in the corporate income tax rate in 2008, a series of policies to reduce or exempt taxes and fees were introduced to strengthen and improve macro-control through management of public finance and promote steady and rapid economic growth. This led to the slower growth in national revenue. National revenue grew by 5.2% in the second half of the year, while revenue collected by the central government dropped by 0.9%. Main revenue items in the central budget. Domestic VAT reached 1.349742 trillion yuan, up 16.3% and equivalent to 100.7% of the target. Domestic sales tax reached 256.78 billion yuan, a rise of 16.4% and equivalent to 104% of the target. VAT and sales tax on imports amounted to 739.107 billion yuan, up 20.1% and equivalent to 107.8% of the target. VAT and sales tax rebates for exports totaled 586.59 billion yuan, up 4.1% and equivalent to 102% of the target, which represents a decrease in revenue by the same amount. Business tax totaled 23.21 billion yuan, an increase of 14.5% and equivalent to 103.2% of the target. Corporate income tax registered 717.34 billion yuan, a rise of 27% and equivalent to 111.6% of the target, with the high increase mainly due to the large increase in corporate income tax in 2007. Individual income tax reached 223.418 billion yuan, up 16.9% and equivalent to 110.1% of the target, with the large increase mainly due to the growth of per capita disposable income for urban residents and improved collection and management. The securities transaction stamp tax reached 94.968 billion yuan, down 51.2% and equivalent to 48.8% of the target, with the shortfall due to a large decline in revenue triggered by the sluggish stock market, the reduction of the securities transaction stamp tax rate and the scrapping of the stamp tax on stock purchases. Tariffs hit 176.995 billion yuan, an increase of 23.6% and equivalent to 110.6% of the target, mainly due to the rapid growth of general imports. Non- tax revenue hit 170.451 billion yuan, up 23.6% and equivalent to 118.4% of the target, with the high increase mainly due to the increase in fees for mineral prospecting and mining rights and resource consumption charges as well as mineral resource compensation fees following reform of the system for paid use of resources. The use of surplus revenue. National revenue exceeded the budget target by 283.09 billion yuan, including a 108.02 billion yuan surplus in the central budget. The main reasons for the surplus are as follows: increases in real terms in economic indexes directly related to tax revenue, including the value-added of industry and commerce, total fixed asset investment, total volume of imports and exports and total retail sales of commodities, exceeded the projected figures. In addition, the increase in corporate income tax added to national revenue by a large margin due to the considerable increase in corporate profits in 2007. Surplus revenue in the central budget was used in the following areas in accordance with relevant laws and regulations as well as resolutions and decisions of the First Session of the Eleventh NPC. A total of 18.5 billion yuan was used to increase tax rebates and transfer payments to local governments. Two billion yuan was spent on education, the bulk of which went to students in the quake zone in need of special temporary assistance. Another 500 million yuan went to science and technology for independent research and development work on major scientific research equipment. Four billion yuan of surplus revenue from vehicle purchase tax receipts was transferred to the central government fund for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction to rebuild damaged roads through expenditures from vehicle purchase tax receipts. Another 29.1 billion yuan was used to increase subsidies for agriculture, fisheries, forestry and other industries to offset the increases in the prices of refined petroleum products in June. An additional 4.7 billion yuan went to providing disaster relief, handling public emergencies and providing further relief for victims of massive natural disasters, the earthquake and the baby milk formula scandal. In response to the global financial crisis and in order to further boost domestic demand, the central government increased spending by 30 billion yuan mainly to build low-income housing and major infrastructure facilities. Finally, 19.2 billion yuan was added to the central budget stabilization fund to be incorporated into the budget in the years ahead. The State Council has reported the use of the surplus in 2008 to the Standing Committee of the Eleventh NPC.

NYT_ENG_20080805.0191,"BC-WEYERHAEUSER TO CUT 1,500 JOBS -SPI WEYERHAEUSER TO CUT 1,500 JOBS  WEYERHAEUSER TO CUT 1,500 JOBS. SEATTLE--Weyerhaeuser Co., which moved its headquarters to Federal Way long before the South King County community was even a formal city, now plans to cut its employment there by 40 percent, or 1,000 jobs. The forest-products company said Tuesday it will eliminate 1,500 corporate-level jobs in the next 18 months, a streamlining move driven by a strategic plan to concentrate on fewer lines of business, and one prompted by a long and deep economic slump in many of those businesses. Nine hundred of the job cuts, some of which have already been made, will be completed this year, with the balance to be done in 2009. Weyerhaeuser spokesman Bruce Amundson said 1,000 of the cuts will be made in Federal Way, where it currently employs about 2,500. The other 500 jobs to be eliminated will be at Weyerhaeuser sites around the country. Most will be layoffs, though some positions will be eliminated through attrition, Amundson said. The job cuts follow Weyerhaeuser's sale of two major parts of its operations--the fine papers business to Domtar last year and the containerboard packaging operations to International Paper, a transaction completed this week. A smaller Weyerhaeuser doesn't need the same number of accountants, lawyers, human-resource and information technology personnel and other support staff that a larger company required. ""We're half as big as we were two years ago,"" Amundson said. At the end of 2007, Weyerhaeuser had 37,900 employees. Following not just the divestitures of major operations (the containerboard operation alone accounted for 14,000 jobs) but also the closing of mills in response to the economic slump, Weyerhaeuser's corporatewide employment is 23,900. ""We've started restructuring our corporate support staff to meet the needs of our more tightly focused company,"" said Chief Executive Dan Fulton on a conference call with investors following the release of second-quarter earnings. ""As we move forward, we will continue to pursue other opportunities to streamline the organization."" Amundson said the cuts were more about reducing the size of the company than a reaction to economic conditions that contributed to a $96 million second-quarter loss, although ""the economy has accelerated the pace at which we've made changes."" Weyerhaeuser has been under pressure from two directions. One is its markets, in the form of the housing slump that hurts sales of wood products such as lumber as well as home sales by its real estate operations (including Puget Sound-region homebuilder Quadrant). The other is Wall Street, which wants to see Weyerhaeuser not only improve its financial performance but pare itself down to a few core businesses. Some have suggested the company go so far as to convert itself to a real estate investment trust, which would force it to unload most of its manufacturing operations, keeping the timberlands. The most recent quarterly results showed the effects of those pressures. The second quarter included a $206 million charge to write down the value of real-estate assets. Weyerhaeuser said it reduced lumber production by 30 percent from 2006 capacity levels, and oriented strandboard production by 48 percent. ""The housing market remains exceptionally difficult,"" said Lawrence Burrows, president of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., on the conference call. ""The traditionally strong second-quarter spring selling season never materialized. Reduced demand and lower consumer confidence has led to increasing excess inventory of new and existing homes which now approaches 11 months."" One troubled market is the Puget Sound region, which he said ""has significantly slowed."" But Weyerhaeuser is hoping that a more narrow focus on specific businesses--timberlands, wood products, real estate and cellulose fibers (including pulp used in such consumer products as diapers)--combined with a tax change on forest products companies will position it for an eventual economic rebound, which Fulton said could come in late 2009 or early 2010. Weyerhaeuser is looking at ways to squeeze more revenue from its businesses and assets, including a biofuels development joint venture with Chevron and increased sales or leases of mineral rights on its lands. Shares of the company closed Tuesday at $53.96, down 60 cents a share. In March 2006 the stock was trading as high as $86 a share. Weyerhaeuser said it expects to save $375 million in annual operating expenses as a result of the job cuts. One of those laid off was Ray Oen, who had worked in supply chain logistics and analysis. ""I don't feel good about it, but something will come up, hopefully,"" he said. Oen said he and other employees had been told by executives last spring that the company was reviewing sales, general and administrative expenses. ""Everyone knew something was coming, just not the timing,"" he said. Oen is already looking for another job, one that will allow him to stay in the area. He's not looking to stay in the forest products industry. His preference for a new occupational industry is ""one that's growing."" Tom Pierson, chief executive of the Federal Way Chamber of Commerce, said people in the community had a sense a downsizing was coming, just from what they'd read about the industry and the company. ""The economy's affecting everyone,"" he said. ""This is just another piece of it."" The company, which moved its headquarters from downtown Tacoma to Federal Way in 1971, has been ""a great corporate and community partner in this region,"" Pierson said, so the cuts will have an impact on employees, service providers and vendors that do business with Weyerhaeuser and cities in the south Puget Sound region, he added. ""We'll do what we can to assure that Weyerhaeuser is here for the long haul."" Federal Way was officially incorporated in 1990; today its population is about 88,000. In the meantime, Federal Way officials will be scrambling to fill the real estate hole left by Weyerhaeuser's contraction. At one time Weyerhaeuser occupied space not only at its distinctive, low-slung headquarters building east of Interstate 5 but in office parks on the other side of the freeway, an area known as West Campus. As the company has downsized it has given up much of that space. Once the latest moves are done, Weyerhaeuser's Federal Way presence will be limited to the headquarters building and the nearby Tech Center, Amundson said. Pat Doherty, economic development director for the city of Federal Way, said the city plans to roll out a new marketing campaign in coming weeks to entice businesses to relocate. ""We have a fair amount of vacant office space,"" he said.","{'development', 'information technology', 'action', 'economic development'}",0.025685758406738358

APW_ENG_19980127.1721,"None. the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent. And the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress. Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years. My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts, targeted to the needs of working families. For education. For child care. For the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test. Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit. Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first. Thank you. Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that's every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. Let us say _ let us say to all Americans watching tonight _ whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system _ Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment. Social Security first. Let's do that _ together. I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion. In facing these issues squarely. In forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country. And I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold the White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: A Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. Thank you. In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage. The information age is first and foremost and information age in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a ten-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door. Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people, have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation. Expanding public school choice. Opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools. Working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway. Committing to expand Head Start to a million children. Launching America Reads. Sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read. Last year, I proposed and you passed 220,00 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit _ a Hope scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that and you should be very proud of it. And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up _ their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up _ he can go on to college. Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And my friends, that will change the face and future of America. Thank you. We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well. By raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics. And every parent already knows the key _ good teachers and small classes. Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My _ thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who pass the state competency test. Now, with these teachers _ listen, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America. Now, if I got the math right, more teachers, teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools. Thank you. We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools. Last year _ last year in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion, and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up. I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn and we will give you the tools to make sure they do. I also asked this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college. Thank you. As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last five years we have led the way in opening new markets with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, Made in the USA. Today, record-high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world. Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears. First, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business. And second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them. This year, I will send legislation to Congress and ask other nations to join us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all _ abusive child labor. Thank you. We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more and more quickly to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason. You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes. Thank you. Thank you. Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for workers _ a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures. Now, we all know in every way in life, change is not always easy. But we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs. So this year, we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support. I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every president has had for two decades. You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond. Now why should Americans be concerned about this? First, these countries are our customers. If they sink in a recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors. So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods which makes it a lot tougher four our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security. The American economy remains sound and strong and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world. Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself. But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund. Thank you. And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead. A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Last year after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal _ two full years ahead of schedule. This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope. For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off welfare. Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up. We still have a lot more to do _ all of us _ to make welfare reform a success. Providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year. We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children. This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this. You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. Thank you. Thank you. Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless. Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face _ an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress _ let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children. Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives. In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993. Since then about 15 million people have taken advantage of it _ and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor. Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts _ America's first lady. Thank you. Thank you. From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable. So here's my plan. Help families to pay for child care for a million more children. Scholarships and background checks for child care workers and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees, and a larger child care tax credit for working families. Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax. You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity? We don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love. A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention, with crime fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road. I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down. Robbery is down. Assault is down. Burglary is down. For five years in a row, all across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets. And again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it. Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders. Thank you. Police, prosecutors and prevention programs _ good as they are _ they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: ``Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.'' I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down. We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it. Today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not. Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies. By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century. Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. Thank you. Thank you. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation. The progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, ``This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory.'' I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight, Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent. Please stand up. In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy. I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them. I'm pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff _ Generals John Shaliskasvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe _ have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year. Thank you. Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world. And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before. We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again. Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace. Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. Thank you. More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part. Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union. To all of you, I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community. First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear _ a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year. But _ at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs _ the high cost of media advertising. For the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates to observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the federal payroll by 300,000 workers; cut 16,000 pages of regulation; eliminated hundreds of programs; and improved the operations of virtually every government agency. But we can do more. Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there. New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers. Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate _ Follow the House. Pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on so I'll be out of trouble. A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, clean-up of polluted sites for development. Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas. We should _ thank you. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing. Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here. Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future. Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit. Last year, we put in place the toughest ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children. Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella. Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children. Thank you. Thank you. Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt or climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk. This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency. We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation. And our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again. Thank you. Thank you. Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard round the world: That we're all created equal. Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived up to it. Often, it is easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong. What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation _ what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer cannot be to dwell in our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities. I have launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is unAmerican. We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask you help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait. Thank you. We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans _ without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation. We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens _ including every one of you at home watching tonight _ is also committed to this cause. We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many. We must be one. Thank you. In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public/private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future. Now, think about this _ the entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene that caused Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime. Soon, we will be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century. Tonight as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute. We have already discovered... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases. As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings. We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace. Think of this _ the first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web _ literally, just a handful of people. Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day. We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. But we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For one thing, I asked Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know? And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today. Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space. Throughout all history, human kindness had only one place to call home _ our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens. The international space station, with its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn. John, you will carry with you America's hopes. And on your uniform once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future. Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag _ its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle _ moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope _ the words that became our national anthem. Today, that star spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures and we must also save them for the ages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America. An America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation. To widen the circle of opportunity. To deepen the meaning of our freedom. To form that more perfect union. Let that be our gift to the 21st century. God bless you and God bless the United States.

LTW_ENG_20080327.0034,"MOVIE GUIDE ALT: Independent, Limited Release and Foreign-Language films. ""All in  This Tea"" --  Like the drink whose virtues it describes, this documentary is brisk and agreeable, a hand-crafted ode, directed by the veteran Les Blank, to the brew that is the beverage of choice where the Chinese, among many others, are concerned.  (1:10) Unrated.     ""Beaufort"" --  The final days of 2000 mark the end of a young Israeli army unit's withdrawal from an ancient fortress in south Lebanon. With Oshri Cohen, Itay Tiran and Eli Eltonyo. Directed and co-written by Joseph Cedar, based on a true story and Ron Leshem's novel. In Hebrew with English subtitles.     ""Blindsight"" --  Six blind Tibetan teenagers are inspired to climb a 23,000-foot peak near Mount Everest. Directed by Lucy Walker. PG for some thematic elements and mild language.     ""CJ7"" --  This disappointing new comedy by Hong Kong filmmaker Stephen Chow (""Shaolin Soccer,"" ""Kung Fu Hustle"") about a poor construction worker putting his young son (Xu Jiao) through a posh academy and the unusual toy he finds for him is as clumsy and awkward as his previous films were stylishly silly. A hodgepodge of ""E.T.,"" ""Gremlins"" and a host of old Disney comedies, its occasionally endearing schmaltz is eclipsed by bizarre shifts in tone and a lackluster story.  (1:26) PG for language, thematic material, some rude humor and brief smoking     ""Dying to Live: The Journey Into a Man's Open Heart"" --  If you're settling in for a first-person documentary with that title, you can't say you weren't warned. A regrettably graceless video diary of one man's overpowering grief and tsoris, it chronicles an emotionally turbulent year or so in which the 49-year-old Ben Mittleman -- a self-proclaimed ""golden boy Jew"" who acted professionally for many years -- learned he had the same dangerous heart ailment that afflicted his now-deceased father. There's not much to say about a navel-gazing effort like this, since it reflects less an artful examination of mortality than a sentimental revisiting of love and tears.  (1:50) Unrated.     ""Flash Point"" --  Donnie Yen and Collin Chou star in this mixed martial arts saga about a Hong Kong detective trying to protect his mole from a murderous crime family. Directed by Wilson Yip. R for strong bloody violence and brutal martial arts action.     ""Fighting For Life"" --  Any film that begins with a cadaver dissection isn't likely to be a cakewalk, yet Terry Sanders' Iraq War-themed, medical documentary is more moving and life affirming than its grim subject matter might suggest. Yes, the movie's blunt combat injury footage is hard to watch but the pure emotion Sanders captures in the military doctors and nurses interviewed -- as well as in the traumatically wounded -- helps ease the film's bleaker moments.  (1:29) Unrated.     ""Funny Games"" --  If you are in the market for unspeakable horror but wouldn't be caught dead slinking into ""Saw IV,"" Michael Haneke is definitely the go-to guy for you. His latest postmodern smackdown is about a happy middle-class couple and their young son whose summer cottage is invaded by a pair of psychos. ""Funny Games"" is actually a shot-for-shot remake of Haneke's 1997 German-language original. Like a recurring plague, it's back -- in English this time, and starring Naomi Watts and Tim Roth. It takes a special arrogance to remake one's own movie frame by frame. Was the original so perfect?  (1:52) R for terror, violence and some language.     ""Girls Rock!"" --  An energetic documentary set at an event called Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Girls that takes place every summer in a warehouse in Oregon. During a week of workshops, girls who attend in effect go from zero to hero: they learn instruments, often for the first time, form bands, write a rock song and perform it in front of an audience of 750. When the camp director says, ""It doesn't have to be polished,"" she is putting it mildly.  (1:30) PG for thematic elements and language.     ""The Grand"" --  Six poker players compete in the world's second most famous high stakes tournament in this improvisational comedy. With Woody Harrelson, David Cross, Dennis Farina, Cheryl Hines, Ray Romano, Werner Herzog and Gabe Kaplan. Directed by Zak Penn. R for language and some drug content.     ""The Hammer"" --  Adam Carolla stars as a 40-year-old ex-boxer suddenly inspired to undertake an unlikely bid for Olympic gold. With Heather Juergensen and Oswaldo Castillo. Directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld.     ""Last Stop For Paul"" --  Neil Mandt wrote, directed and stars in this story of two friends who travel around the world to scatter the ashes of their recently deceased pal. The film is a micro-indie passport party that while well intentioned, stirs the same feelings that have been known to arise from being subjected to your friends' vacation movies: I'm glad you had an awesome time, but why exactly am I supposed to be interested?  (1:23) PG-13 on appeal for some drug use, sexual content and a disturbing image.     ""Married Life"" --  Chris Cooper plays a married businessman who has fallen in love with a younger woman. Harry wants to marry her (Rachel McAdams), but for that he'd have to leave his wife (Patricia Clarkson), whom he loves too much to see suffer. To spare her the pain of losing him, he decides to kill her instead. But Ira Sach's film turns out to be as indefinable as the condition it's named for, though not nearly as satisfying. What you want from it is no more and no less than what the title promises -- an absurdist tragicomedy, anchored in realism. Instead, you get a story about a love quadrangle that starts as a comedy of manners and ends as a drama.  (1:30) PG-13 for some thematic elements and a scene of sexuality.     ""My Name Is Albert Ayler"" --  Jazz saxophonist Ayler's iconoclastic free-form innovations still have a devoted following, but in the pantheon of 20th century jazz innovators, he remains a relatively obscure figure. With this film, Swedish filmmaker Kasper Collin doesn't set out to solve the mysteries surrounding Ayler's life and death so much as to honor them. His poignant and well-researched documentary is an impressionistic portrait of a man whose ecstatic braying tenor sax still sounds fresh.  (1:19) Unrated.     ""Nana"" --  A delightful film with appeal beyond its target audience of eenage girls. Director Kentaro Otani persuasively charts the growing emotional maturity of two young women, both named Nana, who have come to Tokyo to build new lives. His stars, Mika Nakashima and Aoi Miyazaki, are as talented as they are attractive.  (1:53) Unrated. Suitable for teens.     ""Paranoid Park"" --  This movie is the fourth in what feels like a series of films by Gus Van Sant to deal with death in a lyrical-prosaic style. Based on a young adult novel by Blake Nelson, it's a study in angst and guilt made visible by the gorgeous camera work of Christopher Doyle and otherwise palpable by Van Sant's beautiful direction. The movie unwraps its mystery slowly and meticulously, in a roundabout, almost incidental way that mirrors its young protagonist's slow, stunned realization of his part in a horrible act.  (1:18) R for some disturbing images, language and sexual content.     ""Planet B-Boy"" -- Breakdancing came and went as a passing fad, its claim on popular culture consumed in the space between ""Flashdance"" and ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo."" Not so fast, says Benson Lee, whose documentary shows that breaking is alive and thrillingly well all over the globe. The nexus has shifted a bit, from the housing projects of the Bronx to the sleepy town of Braunschweig, Germany, where crews from the 'hoods of Estonia and South Africa converge to compete in the Battle of the Year. The real attraction are the consistently jaw-dropping dance sequences, which are edited with enough skill to make you want to see more and regret that you don't.  (1:41) Unrated.     ""Shelter"" --  An aspiring artist makes sacrifices for his sister and her son, but a clandestine romance with a surfer makes him re-examine his life. With Trevor Wright, Brad Rowe and Tina Holmes. Written and directed by Jonah Markowitz. R for language, some sexual content and brief drug use.     ""Sleepwalking"" --  The melodrama of a broken family haunted by its past, a perennial favorite of independent filmmakers, gets a forceful but ultimately flawed workout from writer Zac Stanford and director William Maher. Terrific performances and a bleak, riveting look at life on the economic fringes eventually gives way to an overly familiar tale of abuse, denial and catharsis that feels like warmed over Sam Shepard minus the poetry.  (1:40) R for language and a scene of violence.     ""Snow Angels"" --  Based on a novel by Stewart O'Nan and set in an unidentified Northern town in the dead of winter, David Gordon Green's film opens with a wink and a bang -- or, to be precise, two of them. A high school marching band is fumbling through a desultory rendition of Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" when a couple of shots ring out from the nearby woods. The sudden sense of menace cuts through what until then has felt like a wry and witty but familiar set-up for a bittersweet comedy, which is why even with the threat firmly established, the brutal end comes as a shock. ""Snow Angels"" begins with a wink and ends with a sucker punch, which somehow doesn't feel fair.  (1:46) R for language, some violent content, brief sexuality and drug use.     "" 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris"" --  Raymond De Felitta's film takes a personal interest in the late jazz vocalist, whose career seems like an endless string of bad breaks. Esteemed by his peers, Paris appeared on records by Charles Mingus and Charlie Parker, and even cut the first vocal take on Thelonious Monk's "" 'Round Midnight."" The documentary picks up speed when it begins to examine the causes of Paris' fate rather than simply bemoaning it. With a short and sometimes violent temper, Paris seems to have let himself down as often as others did. He is less a victim of circumstances than a tragic hero.  (1:40) Unrated.     ""Towards Darkness (Hacia la Oscuridad)"" --  This bilingual thriller tracks the kidnapping of a banker's son in Colombia. With Roberto Urbina and America Ferrera. Written and directed by Antonio Negret. Rated R for some strong violence, language and a scene of sexuality.     ""The Unforeseen"" --  Through analysis of a development near Austin, Texas, filmmaker Laura Dunn explores the environmental and philosophical issues of humanity's interaction with nature. Features the poetry of Wendell Berry.     ""Under the Same Moon (La Misma Luna)"" --  A crowd-pleaser when it debuted at Sundance 2007 under the title ""La misma luna,"" this largely Spanish language film brings on the tears because its core story of a young son and his mother separated by the U.S.-Mexico border is undeniably affecting. The whole movie, however, would be more convincing if the elements around that vital core were more multidimensional and less contrived.  (1:49) PG-13 for some mature thematic elements.","{'innovation', 'development', 'research', 'action'}",0.014272230112660806

""Blindsight"" --  Six blind Tibetan teenagers are inspired to climb a 23,000-foot peak near Mount Everest. Directed by Lucy Walker. PG for some thematic elements and mild language.     ""Chicago 10"" --  Brett Morgen's rousing and entertaining ""Chicago 10"" is a re-construction of the events surrounding the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and of the conspiracy trial, a year later, of the activists and protesters known as the Chicago 7 (originally the Chicago 8: Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner and Bobby Seale). Morgen weaves the events together from archival footage and animated sequences voiced by well-known actors and underscores them with '60s protest music and more recent tracks.  (1:43) R for language and brief sexual images.     ""City of Men"" --  This film might be considered a kindler, gentler companion to Fernando Meirelles' riveting 2002 film, ""City of God."" But given the violent, steamy backdrop of Rio de Janeiro's dense favelas, those are relative terms indeed. ""City of Men"" takes a less frenetic approach to the stories of the young people living in the hillside slums, focusing on the friendship of two young men as they turn 18. Our investment in their plight is ultimately enough to withstand the contrivance of the plot thread that tests their relationship.  (1:50) R for violent content, language and some sexuality.     ""CJ7"" --  This disappointing new comedy by Hong Kong filmmaker Stephen Chow (""Shaolin Soccer,"" ""Kung Fu Hustle"") about a poor construction worker putting his young son (Xu Jiao) through a posh academy and the unusual toy he finds for him is as clumsy and awkward as his previous films were stylishly silly.

(1:18) R for some disturbing images, language and sexual content.     ""Romulus, My Father"" --  This film is the poignant, occasionally harrowing story of a young boy growing up in the Australian Bush not long after the end of World War II. The tragedies of his young life are punctuated with scenes of bucolic splendor and sudden discovery, and actors Kodi Smit-McPhee and Eric Bana have an easy rapport that radiates devotion and mutual respect. For all its sad moments, ""Romulus, My Father"" is a love story between father and son kept aloft by unalloyed admiration.  (1:49) R for sexuality, some violence and brief language.

""Summer Palace"" --  As provocative politically as it is candid sexually, this exceptionally ambitious and assured Chinese film is an intense romantic epic covering two continents and more than a dozen years of recent Chinese history. It's the swirling story of love in a time of revolutionary upheaval, a film where personal chaos mirrors the political to mesmerizing and unsettling effect. It's the story of the Tiananmen Square generation that treats the restlessness of youth not as an indulgent cliche but as something painfully real.  (2:20) Unrated.

""Vivere"" --  Francesca (Esther Zimmering) lives with her father and younger sister on the outskirts of Cologne, where Francesca drives a cab at night. When her sister mysteriously disappears, their father sends Francesca off to find her. The older sister doesn't get far before she comes across a wrecked car on a lonely road with an unconscious woman slumped inside it. She stops to help, and soon finds herself pulled in by the woman's mysterious aura. The wave-like ""Rashomon"" structure of the story, combined with a steady pace and moody look is lulling, but in the end the situation is neither believable nor unbelievable enough to be very compelling. In German with English subtitles.  (1:37) R for some sexual content, language and brief drug use.     ""A Walk to Beautiful"" --  This documentary will leave you speechless two times over, first with despair, then with joy. Even its difficult subject matter, its focus on women in Ethiopia who suffer from chronic incontinence because of  childbirth injuries, can't keep this film from having a power over your heart that is unparalleled. The difference in these women between the day they arrive at the hospital and the day they leave, wearing symbolic new clothes, is as stark as night and day. ""I am glad God gave us doctors,"" one deeply grateful woman says. By the time the film is over, you will agree.

NYT_ENG_20001204.0315,"WHERE TO PLANT YOUR FEET IN THE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE. In the 19th century the innovations of the industrial revolution _ the railroad, the telegraph and mass production factories, among others _ helped transform the economic and social geography of America. The digital revolution is working a similar transformation on the American landscape today, argues the writer Joel Kotkin in his jumbled new book, ``The New Geography.'' Whereas many avatars of high tech contend that the ascendancy of the Internet and wireless communication will free people from the constraints of place (and for that matter, from the bounds of the non-virtual world), Kotkin, a senior fellow with the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University, argues that these developments have made geography more important than ever. If people and businesses are freed by technology to move wherever they want, he reasons, then ``the question of where to locate becomes increasingly contingent on the peculiar attributes of any given location.'' In the transition to a digital economy, Kotkin argues, the ``quality of life'' quotient, rather than access to raw materials or ports, will become increasingly important, turning three types of places into magnets for the technological elite, skilled workers and the upwardly mobile. The first are cities like New York and Los Angeles, rich in ``such creatively driven fields as media, fashion, advertising and design.'' Then, there are the new high-end suburbs (or ``nerdistans'' in the author's terminology) like Irvine, Calif., and Raleigh, N.C., that seek to eliminate the sorts of distractions _ crime, traffic, commercial blight _ ``that have commonly been endemic in cities and increasingly in older suburban areas.'' And finally, there are the upscale rural areas (or ``Valhallas'') like Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Park City, Utah, with ``significant urbanlike amenities and appealing scenery, where knowledge workers can enjoy a pastoral paradise yet remain plugged into the burgeoning information economy.'' Among the losers in the new digital world, Kotkin suggests, are cities like St. Louis and Detroit, built around ``a mass-industrial base'' and lacking ``any sustainable appeal for the new urbanites;'' older suburbs (like Upper Darby near Philadelphia and Harvey outside Chicago), subject to the flight of businesses and the middle class, and well on their way ``to becoming highly diverse suburban slums''; and rural communities _ in nondescript portions of the Great Plains, Appalachia, the South and West _ that ``depend on ranching, lumbering, fishing and farming'' for their economic well-being.","{'innovation', 'development', 'action', 'well-being'}",0.0
