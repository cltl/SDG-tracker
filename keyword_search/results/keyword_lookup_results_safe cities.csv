biotechnology. The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) High-level Conference on Agriculture Cooperation released a Chairman's Statement here Wednesday, calling for ASEM members to take risk assessment and risk management measures in biotechnology utilization to ensure protection of bio-diversity, environment and health of people and animals. The statement noted that biotechnology can contribute to solving major socio-economic problems such as scarcity of resources, environmental degradation and food security if potential risks to the environment and human health are addressed. The conference held that although modern agricultural biotechnology has the potential to become an important tool to achieve sustainable development of agriculture in ASEM member nations and other parts of the world, public acceptance and support is essential to the development and use of biotechnology and likely to be optimized when application is demand-driven. The conference noted that there exists a gap among ASEM members in research and development, application and safety evaluation of agricultural biotechnology. There is therefore a need for international cooperation and support for upgrading capacities in establishing legal and regulatory systems and in research and development in biotechnology to address local needs. The conference suggested that ASEM members strengthen cooperation in this respect through regular dialogues and discussions among experts. The priority areas could include research and development and functional genome analysis, exchange of information on regulatory systems and international commitments concerning biotechnology, and cooperation in the formulation of standards related to biotechnology.","{'diversity', 'risk management', 'sustainable '}",102550

More than 200 world experts and  officials gathered Wednesday in eastern China's Jiangxi Province  to discuss sustainable lake management at the 11th International  Living Lakes Conference. The conference, the first of its kind in China, is a platform  for participants to share success stories of how to balance  agricultural development and lake protection, said Marion Hammerl, president of Global Nature Fund (GNF), the conference sponsor. Participants will also discuss avian influenza and wildlife  habitat conservation. Despite big efforts to protect lakes, the current situation is  still grim as more that half of the 25 lakes in the Living Lakes  Network are facing serious problems caused by agricultural  pollution. The safety of local water resources is threatened,  according to Marion Hammerl. In addition, increasing population, industrialization and  urbanization have had a severe impact on the lakes' biodiversity.","{'diversity', 'urbanization', 'sustainable '}",106788

Annual Meeting 2009 (part II). We encourage our enterprises to upgrade technologies and make technological renovation. We support them in making extensive use of new technologies, techniques, equipment and materials to restructure their product mix, develop marketable products and improve their competitiveness. Our financial support policies are being improved, a sound credit guarantee system installed and market access eased for the benefit of SME development. Fourth, actively encourage innovation and upgrading in science and technology. We are speeding up the implementation of the National Program for Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development with a special focus on 16 key projects in order to make breakthroughs in core technologies and key generic technologies. This will provide scientific and technological support for China's sustainable economic development at a higher level. We are developing high-tech industrial clusters and creating new social demand and new economic growth areas. Fifth, substantially raise the level of social security. We have accelerated the improvement of social safety net. We will continue to increase basic pension for enterprise retirees and upgrade the standard of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation. We will raise the level of basic cost of living allowances in both urban and rural areas, welfare allowances for those rural residents without family support and the special allowances and assistance to entitled groups. This year, the central budget for social security and employment will increase at a much higher rate than the growth of the overall fiscal revenue. We are advancing the reform of the medical and health system and working to put in place a nationwide basic medical and health system covering both urban and rural areas within three years and achieve the goal of everyone having access to basic medical and health service. It is estimated that governments at all levels will invest RMB 850 billion for this purpose. We give priority to education and are now working on the Guidelines of the National Program for Medium- and Long-Term Educational Reform and Development. This year, we will increase public funds for compulsory education in rural areas, offer more financial support to students from poor families and improve the well-being of middle and primary school teachers so as to promote equity in education and optimize the educational structure. We are using every possible means to lessen the impact of the financial crisis on employment. We are following a more active employment policy. In particular, we have introduced various policy measures to help college graduates and migrant workers find jobs and provided more government-funded jobs in public service. These major policy measures as a whole target both symptoms and root causes, and address both immediate and long-term concerns. They represent a holistic approach and are mutually reinforcing. They are designed to address the need to boost domestic demand, readjust and reinvigorate industries, encourage scientific innovation and strengthen social security. They are designed to stimulate consumption through increased investment, overcome the current difficulties with long-term development in mind, and promote economic growth in the interest of people's livelihood. These measures can mobilize all resources to meet the current crisis. China's economy is in good shape on the whole. We managed to maintain steady and relatively fast economic growth in 2008 despite two unexpected massive natural disasters. Our GDP grew by 9 percent. CPI was basically stable. We had a good grain harvest for the fifth consecutive year, with a total output of 528.5 million tons. Eleven million and one hundred and thirty thousand new jobs were created in cities and towns. Household income in both urban and rural areas continued to rise. The financial system functioned well and the banking system kept its liquidity and credit asset quality at a healthy level. When China, a large developing country, runs its affairs well, it can help restore confidence in global economic growth and curb the spread of the international financial crisis. It will also help increase China's imports and outbound investment, boost world economic growth and create more development and job opportunities for other countries. Steady and fast growth of China's economy is in itself an important contribution to global financial stability and world economic growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, Will China's economy continue to grow fast and steadily? Some people may have doubts about it. Yet I can give you a definite answer: Yes, it will. We are full of confidence. Where does our confidence come from? It comes from the fact that the fundamentals of China's economy remain unchanged. Thanks to our right judgment of the situation and prompt and decisive adjustment to our macroeconomic policy, our economy remains on the track of steady and fast development. Our package plan takes into consideration both the need to address current difficulties and that of long-term development. It is beginning to produce results and will be more effective this year. Our confidence comes from the fact that the long-term trend of China's economic development remains unchanged. We are in an important period of strategic opportunities and in the process of fast industrialization and urbanization. Infrastructure construction, upgrading of industrial and consumption structures, environmental protection and conservation projects, and various social development programs—all can be translated into huge demand and growth potential and will bolster relatively high-speed growth of our economy for a long time to come. Our confidence also comes from the fact that the advantages contributing to China's economic growth remain unchanged. With 30 years' of reform and opening-up, we have laid a good material, technological and institutional foundation. We have a large well- trained and relatively low-cost labor force. We have a healthy fiscal balance, a sound financial system and adequate funds. Our system enables us to mobilize the necessary resources for big undertakings. There is harmony and stability in our society. What is more important, we follow a scientific approach to development which puts people first and seeks comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development. We are committed to reform, opening-up and win-win progress. We have found the right development path in line with China's national conditions and the trend of our times. Our people are hard-working, persevering and resilient. It is precisely these fine qualities that endow China, a country with a time-honored history, with greater vitality in the face of adversities. At the same time, there is no fundamental change in the external environment for China's economic growth. The pursuit of peace, development and cooperation is the irreversible trend in today's world. The readjustment to the international division of labor offers new opportunities. We have the confidence, conditions and ability to maintain steady and fast economic growth and continue to contribute to world economic growth.
