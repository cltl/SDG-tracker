More than four decades of legally enshrined sexual equality in China has done little to change deep-rooted discrimination that has kept most women from rising to the top of the career ladder. Mao Zedong's dictum that ""women hold up half the sky"" was no hollow slogan, with the communists ending many traditional abuses like footbinding and arranged marriages after 1949 and giving numerous women a first taste of economic independence by bringing them out of the kitchen into the workplace. In numerical terms, women's political participation also increased dramatically under Mao. But their decision-making power remained limited and, with their jobs ensured by state quotas rather than by tackling the roots of discrimination, old attitudes simply lay dormant, resurfacing with a vengeance when competition returned to China under economic reforms introduced in 1979. ""China's women's liberation movement was not initiated by women themselves in the 1950s but by the government, so, although there were many gains, they were superficial,"" said one long-time campaigner for women's rights.","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'decision-making'}"

The agreement of the major parties to jointly take responsibility in a ``government of national unity'' was a key factor in increasing business confidence in South Africa.

The two-day conference, which ended Thursday, focused on the emigration of women from Latin America to Europe, Asia and other richer regions _ and the complicity of the governments on both ends of the trade. In the Dominican Republic, where the conference was held, between 50,000 and 100,000 women have emigrated to work in Europe, where most are subject to sexual exploitation, according to Irma Nicasio, head of the Dominican government's Office for the Promotion of Women. Many work in ``slave-like conditions,'' held virtual prisoner because the people who arrange their trips confiscate their immigration papers, said Yamile Azize Vargas, a consultant to the Netherlands-based Foundation Against Trafficking in Women.

Jalali, a member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said the panel was based on the constitution, which gives the legislature authority to oversee the performance of all government sectors. It isn't it clear how much influence the committee will have on Iran's decision-making. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters, has ruled out Iran's participation in a U.S.-led coalition against suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, who Washington says is the prime suspect in the attacks. The United States has been assembling troops in the region, warning Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to hand over bin Laden or face consequences. Instead, Iran has lobbied for a U.N.-led campaign.","{'participation', 'leadership', 'decision-making'}"

The document _ signed in Belgrade in the presence of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica _ is meant to encourage Kosovo Serbs to vote in the Nov. 17 elections in the Albanian-majority province. Nebojsa Covic, the top Serb official for Kosovo, described the seven-page document as a ``start of Yugoslavia's return to Kosovo. It is proof that we are not giving up on Kosovo,'' ``Considering all the past violence and terrorism in Kosovo, this day is a landmark,'' Covic said, adding the ``task ahead now is to get Kosovo Serbs to show up at the polls in as large numbers as possible, despite the short time left.''

Millions of children are being bought and sold for use as ``sex slaves,'' according to a new report by the United Nations Children's Fund that called for a global campaign to eradicate the multibillion-dollar sexual exploitation of youngsters. ``Zero tolerance means ending the trafficking of children, their sale and barter and imprisonment and torture,'' UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said in a statement accompanying the report released late Tuesday. ``It means stamping out every horrible facet of the commercial sexual exploitation of children.'' The report, ``Profiting from Abuse,'' which includes statements from women and children lured into the sex trade, was released in conjunction with the Second World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which takes place Dec. 17-20 in Yokohama, Japan. UNICEF, the Japanese government, and voluntary organizations supporting the Convention on the Rights of the Child are co-sponsoring the conference. ``Millions of children throughout the world are being bought and sold like chattel and used as sex slaves,'' Bellamy said. ``This is an utterly intolerable violation of children's rights.'' Because traffickers operate clandestinely shuttling children through underground networks, and because some governments don't recognize the problem, accurate statistics are hard to come by, the report said.","{'trafficking', 'sexual exploitation', 'exploitation'}"

Seven soldiers and three civilians were sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight months to three years for sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl who was kidnapped at the base and ended up in forced prostitution in neighboring Kosovo. Twelve officers of the Bisht Palle naval base in the Durres district, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, were discharged, but not indicted, in December after allegedly failing to stop the girls' abuse on their base.

The 24-year-old's ordeal is increasingly common among citizens of Ukraine, whose country was cited in a recent U.S. State Department report as one of the prime sources of men, women, and children trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor. The report sharply criticized Ukraine's previous government for failing to take decisive action against the problem. The issue could impede new President Viktor Yushchenko's drive to get Ukraine into the European Union. The Interior Ministry this year put combating human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children on its list of key priorities, forming a unit dedicated to the task and beefing up border checks. The country's new government also plans to create a National Bureau to Combat Human Trafficking.

A visiting United Nations official on Friday urged Ukraine to strengthen efforts to combat child trafficking, which he said remained a major problem for the ex-Soviet nation. ""I remain concerned at the low rate of prosecution and sentencing of traffickers, authors of child pornography and other crimes against children,"" said Juan Miguel Petit, a U.N. official in charge of the world body's efforts to stop child prostitution, child pornography and other crimes against children. Petit said that the government should strengthen its efforts to combat the problems. Its recommendations included creating a separate juvenile justice system, naming a special ombudsman on children's rights and setting up a national commission to protect children rights. Ukraine remains a primary source for men, women and children trafficked to Europe, the Middle East and Russia for sexual exploitation and forced labor, according to international experts. Low salaries and high unemployment force thousands of Ukrainians to seek employment abroad, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation, they say. The International Organization for Migration says it has provided assistance to about 3,000 Ukrainians who were victims of trafficking since 2000, but estimates that that number is only a small portion of the victims. Petit said that 10 percent of these victims were children.","{'trafficking', 'sexual exploitation', 'exploitation'}"

The figure was higher than the 4.74 percent growth in the number of men employed over the same five-year period. The women's labor participation rate also saw an increase, from 46.59 percent in 2002 to 48.68 percent in 2006. In contrast, the men's labor participation rate dropped 0.87 percentage points. The CLA conducted a survey on employers in November 2006 and a survey on female employees in January 2007 to explore whether women have suffered inequality or discrimination in the workplace. A total of 3,050 valid samples were collected in the employers survey, while the survey of female employees received 3,074 valid replies. Both surveys have a margin of error of 1.79 percentage points.","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'gender equality'}"

472,LTW_ENG_19960115.0093,"VMI Sex Discrimination Case Goes Before Supreme Court (Washn). One of the most important sex discrimination cases to reach the Supreme Court will be argued this week by disputing parties who depict women in two distinctly different lights. The lawyers for Virginia Military Institute, who are fighting to keep women out of the all-male, state-supported college, say women are very different from men in the way they respond to stress and confrontation. They portray women as better suited for relationships than self-reliance. And they say that despite the lawsuit brought by the federal government, women actually have little interest in the demanding routine of VMI's ``adversative'' method. The Justice Department and others protesting VMI's policy describe women as aggressive, able to thrive on adversity and seeking a VMI-style education. A group of female military officers said in a ``friend of the court'' brief that women ``have demonstrated with their lives that they can withstand the stress of combat situations, the challenges of military leadership and the physical challenges of mobilizing a fighting force. Yet, because of their gender, these Americans are not qualified to attend VMI.'' Of great consequence beyond these dueling perceptions of gender characteristics, the case to be argued Wednesday could produce a new standard for deciding the legality of any classification or discrimination based on sex. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to use the case to rule that bias based on sex warrants the same tough judicial scrutiny as bias based on race. Were the court to elevate the constitutional protection against sex discrimination --  and it is far from a certain that it will -- the impact would be huge. All sorts of programs that particularly benefit men (or women) would be in legal jeopardy. U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III, however, said in a brief to the court, ``The long history of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing under-representation in government, all support the application of strict (judicial) scrutiny here.''","{'discrimination', 'leadership', 'decision-making'}"

Nearly six months after proposing with great fanfare to create an all-African military force to intervene in that continent's trouble spots, a chastened Clinton administration has revised the plan to meet African demands for more decision-making power and overcome French resistance. Since President Clinton approved the original plan several crises have erupted in Africa -- in Zaire, in Sudan and in the Central African Repubic -- but any U.S.-sponsored force is still many months away from deployment, according to administration officials and European and African diplomats. The proposed Africa Crisis Response Force, or ACRF, ``is alive and moving, very much so,'' one senior official said, but ``our original timetable was overly aggressive.'' That timetable called for up to 10,000 African troops to be designated, trained, equipped and prepared for deployment well before the end of this year. So far, however, only two countries have designated military units for potential participation and training has not yet begun, officials said. Mali and Ethiopia declared their willingness to participate when then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Africa in October. According to administration officials and foreign diplomats, many other African countries have endorsed the concept in principle, and several European allies have agreed to support it.

The Supreme Court Monday shut off the last avenue of appeal for American universities and colleges that provide more sports programs for men than women based on their belief that female students are less interested in athletics. Over the protests of sixty colleges and universities, the high court rejected an appeal by Brown University that sought to have a controversial lower court decision requiring strict sex equality in athletic programs overturned. The Supreme Court's denial of the case effectively means that schools nationwide must ensure that the total number of varsity positions for men and women match their overall percentage in the student body. Monday's action is likely to accelerate the trend among schools to scale back men's athletics and pump up women's sports to meet the gender equality standard required by federal law. Although the law at issue, Title IX, has existed for 25 years, the lower court ruling was particularly controversial because it defined a strict standard of parity for young women athletes -- potentially at the expense of male athletes. At Brown, for example, women composed 51 percent of the student body, yet they represented only 38 percent of campus athletes. That 13 percent differential, according to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, amounted to illegal discrimination. To rectify the imbalance, universities and colleges that receive federal funds must either cut back or eliminate some men's sports, or add women's teams. The effect of the high court action is not that schools must offer the same sports to both sexes -- just because men have a football team doesn't mean women must have one too. Rather, schools overall must provide athletic participation opportunities in numbers that are proportionate to the enrollment of men and women.","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'gender equality'}"

 Bertin is executive director of the National Coalition Against 
 Censorship.. The first round of papers has been filed in a federal appeals court in San Francisco challenging the constitutionality of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996. At the same time, the new movie version of Vladimir Nabokov's book ``Lolita,'' starring Jeremy Irons, is opening all over Europe, even though it is not scheduled for release here. These events are connected. The United States long has had laws prohibiting sexual abuse of minors and trafficking in child pornography. The Supreme Court allows state and federal officials wide authority to protect minors from the sexual exploitation involved in making pornographic material with actual children. In 1996, Congress decided that this wasn't enough, so it added prohibitions. The new law outlaws images that appear to be of children, even if they are not. So even if a movie like ``Lolita'' was filmed with an adult body double, it apparently would be prohibited if it contains simulated sexual conduct that appears to involve a minor. If you recall, that's what ``Lolita'' is about: a man's sexual obsession with a pubescent girl. The theory behind the law is that such images encourage pedophilia. But sexual abuse of minors is already illegal. Human motivation is complicated. There's no persuasive evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to sexually explicit material and rape or sexual abuse or between viewing violence and committing violent crimes. Savage acts (sexual and other, against children and adults) have been undertaken under the influence and in the name of religion, but that doesn't mean religion causes savagery.","{'trafficking', 'sexual exploitation', 'violence', 'exploitation'}"

The military, bulwark of the Suharto reign, is showing itself vulnerable to the conflicting tugs of the society whence it comes. The dead are numbered in the hundreds, the victims of the security forces being the most politically salient among them. On only one previous occasion has postcolonial Indonesia changed leadership. That was in the events in which Mr. Suharto came to power in 1965 -- events in which the army killed a half-million people. He has since been careful to keep his grip on power by a highly controlled process impervious to authentic public participation, let alone consent. This is not the record of someone any sensible person would want to manage the choice of Indonesia's next president. As for political and economic reform, the record is the man. The Indonesian people's lot improved in his time, but at the end collapse came. The riches that his rule brought his family and cronies are the mark of his unfitness. The United States has long regarded Indonesia as a counterweight to Chinese power in both its Communist and national aspects. Washington has been slow to abandon its traditional closeness to an often-repressive military regime. A certain respect for Indonesian society's capacity for violence also had something to do with it. But surely this is a moment when the United States can generate a bit more clarity about its favor for democratic solutions. Mr. Suharto has run out his string and should be replaced promptly by the popular choice. The army should take up an unequivocal role as guardian of the political arena, not its gendarme. Painful decisions about how to share the burdens of economic regeneration need to be made in a democratic context. People should not be wondering where the United States stands.","{'violence', 'leadership', 'participation'}"

Minutes after Elder Anibal Moran and his wife, Veronica Colindres, got into their car to distribute campaign banners last week, the bullets -- a hallmark of the upcoming national elections -- started flying. Moran ran from the car but fell dead 20 feet away, in front of Mery's beauty salon in this small town on the Pacific Ocean. Colindres died on the way to the hospital. Many of the 24 bullets that pierced their red Toyota had hit her, too. It is unclear why the couple's four children were so suddenly orphaned. Family and officials are divided on whether the killings were motivated by politics or drugs. Both have contributed to the alarmingly lawless atmosphere that now reigns in the most populous country in Central America. About 60 people are killed every week in Guatemala City alone, double the murder rate in 2001, according to analysts. They say the violence and bloodshed in this country of 12 million people stems from growing drug trafficking organizations, a broken justice system that investigates as little as 3 percent of all crime and the resurgence of past military leaders. One of the leading candidates for president in the Nov. 9 election is former general Efrain Rios Montt, who was dictator in 1982 and 1983 at the height of Guatemala's bloody civil war. Under his leadership, soldiers and paramilitary squads murdered thousands of unarmed people, mainly Mayan Indians. Human rights activists are now pressing a genocide case against Rios Montt.","{'trafficking', 'violence', 'leadership'}"
479,LTW_ENG_20031209.0078,"Better Health, Better Lives for Sex Workers. Women and girls in the commercial sex industry -- including millions who were trafficked, forced or sold into the trade -- are overwhelmingly at risk of contracting HIV-AIDS. In Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, an estimated 60 percent to 80 percent of those in the sex industry are infected with HIV. Women in sex work almost always are compelled into it by sexual violence, poverty and discrimination. They often are debt-bonded to pimps and brothel owners, and they are marginalized within society. They are vulnerable to violent abuse, including rape and robbery, by local police. Many are young girls, who are much sought after. They often are unable to speak the local language and incapable of negotiating safe sex -- much less their freedom. Their situations are desperate and their lives short. There have been a handful of successful rescues in India, Cambodia and Thailand in which police have raided brothels and taken the younger girls to rehabilitation facilities. But most police raids on brothels have also resulted in the arrest and deportation of adult sex workers and the closing of brothels. Many liberal advocates for sex workers' rights have vigorously denounced past rescue operations and discouraged new ones. Thus is the right of child prostitutes to their freedom from the brothels sacrificed for the adult prostitutes' right to earn a livelihood there. On the other side of the issue are conservatives who oppose not only trafficking but all prostitution. In April HIV-AIDS legislation was amended to require U.S.-funded groups to adopt a position opposing prostitution and trafficking. It could end up defunding some of the most successful HIV-AIDS prevention services and empowerment strategies for women in the sex industry. One such group's representative, describing her effort to help Bangladeshi brothel workers acquire the right to wear shoes or sandals outside of brothels -- a simple dignity denied them by local custom -- stated: ``How can we help these beaten down, marginalized women organize themselves to achieve such victories if we are publicly opposing what they do to earn money?'' Sound health policy requires an approach that helps liberate children and adults from the sex slave trade while securing condoms, health care and protection from police violence for those who remain. A comprehensive approach should include the following:","{'trafficking', 'violence', 'discrimination'}"

482,LTW_ENG_20040818.0124,"Najaf Crisis Highlights Iraqi Leadership Chaos. The uncertain end to the standoff in Najaf highlights a confusing, shared leadership system in Iraq where key decisions about fighting insurgents get made -- or not -- by a combination of U.S. military commanders, American diplomats and Iraqi political leaders. The shared decision-making has led to frustration in the military, U.S. officials acknowledge, as the Bush administration pursues the twin aims of defeating Iraqi insurgents and building up an Iraqi government that eventually will be capable of acting on its own. According to reports from Najaf, U.S. Marines bypassed the system altogether in launching their offensive nine days ago against Shiite militiamen led by the young firebrand cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr. The roots of the confusing, shared command can be found in the diplomatic maneuvering over last spring's U.N. Security Council resolution marking the end of U.S. political control over Iraq. Responding to pressure from the Arab world and Europeans for Iraqis to be granted genuine sovereignty, the United States agreed to an exchange of letters between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi that called for shared responsibility over security.","{'leadership', 'shared responsibility', 'decision-making'}"
483,LTW_ENG_20041106.0018,"The Arafat Enigma. My final meeting with Yasser Arafat took place barely a few weeks ago, in the rubble of his headquarters, over a frugal and flavorless dinner of soup and vegetables. He was outfitted in his trademark military garb, a pile of documents awaiting his signature, aides and colleagues standing by for his attention. The scene was vintage Arafat: the image of armed resistance (when Israel could effortlessly have struck him at moment's notice); the illusion of orderly decision-making (when chaos had long replaced governance); and above all, the reality of personal power. Among his visitors that evening were several of his associates, some of whom had only recently challenged the Palestinian leader. That night, they were doing the talking, Arafat feigning to listen. It was clear who was subordinate and who was boss. For American policymakers, Arafat's ability to exercise this kind of power over several decades and despite serial defeats was a cause of constant bafflement and a source of repeated misjudgments. They thought he would be assessed based on how well he governed and what he achieved. On both counts they found him wanting and expected Palestinians to follow suit. Palestinians did not -- not out of blindness to his failings, which they experienced more acutely than most, but rather, out of a sense that Arafat literally embodied the nation. In the eyes of countless Palestinians, he had taken a dispersed, stateless people, given them dignity and a name, put them on the map, evaded recurring attempts at Arab subjugation and both built and preserved a national movement. For that, they were prepared to forgive in abundance and in perpetuity. As one Palestinian told me, ``his people will always flock to him because he did not sell out -- which compensates for the fact that he did not deliver.'' Even as Arafat lay dying in France last week, his portrait hung over an empty chair in a meeting of the Fatah movement leadership -- just as his absence will hang over those seeking to fill his place. Arafat performed not so much through leadership as through representation, yet another object of U.S. puzzlement. He did not seek to impose decisions, govern through force or subdue rivals via bloodshed. He was the creation more than the creator of Palestinian politics, the expression of an ethereal national consensus, the most fluent reader of Palestinian possibilities and limitations. His personification of the Palestinian political center of gravity was his political currency, which is why he resisted calls to crack down on the violent acts of Hamas or Islamic Jihad or compel order, and it's why, even as he drew close to his last day, he feared Israel's withdrawal from Gaza might give rise to a competing power basis. The flip side was that chaotic pluralism and managed turmoil were his instruments of choice. They gave him maximum maneuvering space, which he considered vital to either maintaining his personal position or achieving Palestinian objectives -- two goals that, alas, he barely and rarely distinguished. The Palestinian leader never had a grand strategy. His life was the stuff of intuition and short-term political expediency. Hence his tortured relationship to peace and violence. Before most of his colleagues, Arafat believed in a peaceful, two-state solution; unlike some of them, he also believed that violence was needed to reach that end. In his universe, regardless of formal pledges, there was no contradiction. Diplomacy and force formed part of a single, coherent continuum. Assessing long-term costs was foreign to his repertoire; if violence suited current needs, he would do little or nothing to oppose it.","{'violence', 'leadership', 'decision-making'}"

Last year, when the Palestinian moderate Mahmoud Abbas briefly served as prime minister, the United States, Israel and the international community failed to give him the support he badly needed, making it all too easy for Yasser Arafat to undercut him. Now, we have a second chance. Arafat is gone and Abbas is favored to win the Palestinian presidential election next month, having made ``the total cessation of violence'' his highest priority. He is currently seeking commitments from all the Palestinian factions for a cease-fire and is determined to bring the various security services under control. His recognition of Palestinian responsibility to act decisively against incitement and terrorism will give Israel what it has been lacking: a partner for peace. But Abbas' re-emergence also raises a fundamental question. Arafat had the capacity to make peace, but lacked the will. Abbas has the will, but does he have the capacity to overcome violence, corruption and the sense of victimization that are a legacy of Arafat's leadership? Israel, the United States and the international community have a shared responsibility to help him build a capacity for peace.","{'violence', 'leadership', 'shared responsibility'}"

The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: The riots in France have provoked their own mini-storm of misinterpretation, outside the country and among some of the French. So it's worth noting what 12 days (so far) of car-burning, looting and occasional shooting in the poor suburbs of Paris, and now dozens of other towns, is not about. It's not the European version of an intifada: Islamic ideology and leaders play no role in the disturbances, and many of those participating are not Muslim. But not all the demonstrators are hoodlums and drug dealers either, as some senior French officials portray them; anger over high unemployment and racism has been building in these ghettos for years. It's also too facile to say that French authorities have ignored the problems. Billions have been spent on urban renewal: High-rise projects have been torn down and enterprise zones created, much as in some American inner cities. As in the United States, interlinked problems of jobs, schools, crime and discrimination have not easily yielded to government solutions. Yet until now, many in France assumed that what they regard as a superior ``social model'' protected them from the eruptions of lawlessness that in recent years have touched Los Angeles, Miami and New Orleans. Caught by surprise, slow to react, plagued by political posturing and finger-pointing, the French leadership is demonstrating that poor crisis response is also not unique to U.S. administrations. Yet beneath the disarray -- embodied in the simultaneously laconic and belligerent behavior of President Jacques Chirac -- some fresh thinking is evident. Ironically, some of it comes from Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who has been pilloried by the demonstrators and left-wing press for his own ugly rhetoric. Mr. Sarkozy recently suggested that France abandon the pretense that all of its citizens -- including an estimated 5 million Muslims -- are treated equally, and adopt affirmative-action policies. He has also promoted the idea of a peaceful and tolerant ``French Islam'' to compete with imported ideologies of extremism. In the short term, French authorities have to take forceful measures to restore order. Should the violence persist, extremists could use it to create political or religious causes that do not now exist. But in the medium term, France would benefit from the kind of re-examination of its policies toward minorities and immigrants that Mr. Sarkozy suggests. It's no longer reasonable to pretend that the poor Muslim descendants of North Africans in crowded housing projects are indistinguishable from all other French. If mainstream politicians do not fashion an agenda of inclusion for them, more militant actors will have a vacuum to fill.","{'violence', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

A call by Deputy Education Minister Donald Rhodd to discuss the possible repeal of Victorian-era laws criminalizing homosexuality has provoked outrage among conservative Jamaicans. But gays and lesbians here see the debate as a glimmer of hope that they may one day move out from the shadows. Criticized by Human Rights Watch a year ago for fostering a climate of violent homophobia, Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are acknowledging that discrimination and denial have proved counterproductive in curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Still, many in the devoutly religious Caribbean reject the notion that gays and lesbians should be granted equal protection under the law, including the rights to associate openly and receive public services, let alone marry. At least eight current or former British colonies in the Caribbean Sea retain anti-sodomy laws, including Barbados, St. Lucia and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Jamaica. But economic realities and the outside world's scorn of anti-gay violence have begun making inroads into the climate of intolerance. The most homophobic of the islands, based on Human Rights Watch's assessment of violence against gays, Jamaica suffers one of the highest incidences of HIV/AIDS, with 1.2 percent of the population infected.

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales unveiled a series of initiatives Wednesday aimed at combating child exploitation, housing discrimination and gang violence, saying that the Justice Department's continued focus on preventing terrorism should not detract from other pressing problems. In a speech to Justice employees and an interview with The Washington Post, Gonzales said the department can take credit over the last year for helping to prevent any further terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and for continued success in falling crime rates. But Gonzales, the former White House counsel who was sworn into office just over a year ago, said the department also must increase its focus on a number of other law enforcement issues. ``Following the attacks of 9/11, the department and everyone else in the administration focused on what we needed to be doing and should be doing to ensure that America is protected,'' Gonzales said in the interview. ``I just wanted to simply send the message to folks in the department and to Americans generally that we also understand we have other obligations or other needs that remain unmet.'' The comments come in the wake of an often tumultuous year in which Gonzales spent much of his time focused on a handful of issues, including renewal of the USA Patriot Act, speculation about his viability as a Supreme Court nominee and, most recently, defending President Bush's warrantless domestic spying program. In half a dozen appearances he made before Congress as attorney general, for example, only one hearing was dominated by topics other than the Patriot Act or other terrorism policies.","{'violence', 'discrimination', 'exploitation'}"

It is multiethnic. It is a multi-religious democracy that is characterized by individual freedom and the rule of law. It is a country with which we share common values. India will soon be the world's most populous nation, and America's exports to India have doubled in only the past four years. And of course, India is a rising global power that we believe can be a pillar of stability in a rapidly changing Asia. In other words, in short, India is a natural partner for the United States.''

Dobriansky, that same day, was releasing a State Department human rights report -- discussing U.S. efforts in every country to promote human rights, that said this about India: ``The Government generally respected the rights of its citizens and continued efforts to curb human rights abuses, although numerous serious problems remained. These included extrajudicial killings, disappearances, custodial deaths, excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, torture, poor prison conditions, and extended pretrial detention, especially related to combating insurgencies in Jammu and Kashmir. Societal violence and discrimination against women, trafficking of women and children for forced prostitution and labor, and female feticide and infanticide remained concerns.

I found his advice peculiar, especially as I had been living in America since age 8 and had largely forgotten my time in India. To him, it didn't matter that the only language in which I could think a complex thought was English. It didn't matter that the only music I listened to was Michael Jackson, the Bee Gees and Billy Joel. My father's dictum infuriated me, in part because I took his comment to be racist. Did he mean that only white people count as real Americans? What about African-Americans, let alone Indian-Americans? I have insisted ever since that in America, what makes someone an American is citizenship, not race or ethnicity. This month -- after hearing Sen. George Allen call an Indian-American, born in this country, ``macaca'' -- I better appreciated my father's sober wisdom. What he meant to say is now apparent: ``You will never be accepted as truly American.'' Education, meaningful work and financial success can get immigrant minorities only so far. For some, whiteness will always be a prerequisite for being American. Conveying that message might not have been Allen's intent, but it certainly was the effect. What's the lesson to be learned from this episode? Must South Asians and other immigrants resign themselves to second-class status -- at least in the eyes of some? Of course ``class'' is the wrong word here. Indian-Americans are, statistically speaking, the wealthiest immigrant group in the nation. We do experience discrimination and, on rare occasions, violence, as some Sikhs did right after Sept. 11, 2001. But discrimination has not had marked economic consequences. It is more often experienced by South Asians as a subtle matter of failed recognition: We are either rendered hyper-visible, marked out as different as S.R. Sidarth was made to feel by George Allen or, in other circles, rendered invisible because we are accorded the status of ``honorary whites.'' Membership in that exclusive fraternity is granted so long as difference is suppressed. The Allen incident offers evidence that America is not now or likely to ever be a color-blind country. How are South Asians to live with this truth? Resignation is not the answer. Vigorous political participation is. My youthful intuition that what makes me as American as any Mayflower descendant is citizenship -- not race or ethnicity -- was only partly on the mark.

As national security adviser to the head of Iraq's governments since March 2004, I have participated in the development of democracy in my country. I strongly support the government and applaud its achievements. But I understand that the political objectives of Iraq's three main communities are unrealizable within the framework of a unitary, centralized state. It has been impossible to maintain a political consensus on many important issues. For one thing, the U.S.-dominated coalition, which has its own objectives, must be accommodated. The regional ""superpowers"" (Iran and Saudi Arabia) meddle in Iraq's affairs, and their own sectarian tensions are reflected in the violence here. The absence of truly national political parties and leadership that reach the Iraqi people exacerbates the problem. Overall, Shiites see their future based on two fundamental ""rights"": Power must be exercised by the political majority through control of governmental institutions, and institutional sectarian discrimination must be eliminated. Kurds see their future bound to their ""rights"" of linguistic, cultural, financial and resource control within Kurdistan. Sunni Arabs are driven by resistance to their loss of power, as well as fear of revenge for past wrongs and the potential for reverse discrimination. The current political framework is based on a pluralistic democratic vision that, while admirable, is entirely unsuited to resolving this three-way divide. It ignores underlying issues and expects that a consensus will emerge simply by enacting a liberal constitutional legal order. Pluralistic democracy will not take root unless the national political compact recognizes and accommodates the fears and aspirations of Iraq's communities. Resolution can be achieved only through a system that incorporates regional federalism, with clear, mutually acceptable distributions of power between the regions and the central government.

But Mexico had not heard such a high-level U.S. official accept shared responsibility for generating and solving the drug wars, and the positive reviews Clinton has been getting remind us that a little mea culpa goes a long way. The day before she arrived in Mexico City, on her first visit as secretary of State, the Obama administration promised to address the problem of southbound weapons trafficking and money laundering. Clinton also sought to quell fury over recent U.S. intelligence assessments that Mexico risks becoming a ""failed state"" along with other countries riven by violence, such as Pakistan. President Felipe Calderon had grown accustomed to unqualified praise from the Bush administration, which sought to bolster the remaining right-of-center governments in Latin America, and was blindsided by the sudden talk of no-go areas in Mexico coming from U.S. military and law enforcement quarters. In a joint meeting with Clinton, Mexican Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa pointedly noted that there are many places in both countries where the two women wouldn't venture. In her role as diplomat in chief, Clinton clarified that the Obama administration does not hold the position that our next-door neighbor is about to collapse into chaos. Clinton is right that the Mexican state and civil society remain strong, and certainly Mexico is able to send the army into any municipality to calm the drug violence, as it has done recently in Ciudad Juarez. But in scores of towns, the civil government and local police are not able to confront the traffickers without the help of the army. The drug cartels have killed thousands and control many more through threats, bribes and taxes. No matter what you call it, that's a problem that both countries must resolve together, as the violence is seeping across the border. Some Mexicans bristle at taking Black Hawk helicopters and other military aid from the behemoth to the north. Critics say ""help"" and ""cooperation"" usually come with strings that suggest U.S. meddling. The United States must remain cognizant of those sensitivities, while staying engaged and supplying aid. Because left unchecked, the drug traffickers will pose a threat to Mexico's stability and, therefore, to our own.","{'trafficking', 'violence', 'shared responsibility'}"

U.S.-Latin American relations are at their lowest point in years, and Obama's pledge to ""re-order"" the agenda is welcome. But beyond spoken commitments, Mexico is looking for concrete assistance in several areas. Powerful drug-trafficking organizations -- who have unleashed a wave of violence that has claimed more than 10,000 lives in just more than two years -- could threaten the very ability of Mexican President Felipe Calderon to govern. Calderon has repeatedly called on the United States to do more to stop the flow of weapons and drug money from the U.S. and to curb the demand for the tons of cocaine and marijuana that Mexican traffickers send northward. ""It is essential that we make the U.S. see the need to fully assume shared responsibility in this fight,"" Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said. ""The Obama visit is a chance to cement new cooperation."" Mexico is also eager to see Washington make immigration reforms and pay greater attention to trade issues but fears those issues might be obscured by the drug war.

A few days later, she was found dead after attempting to escape the traffickers who tried to force her into prostitution. Oxana's story is the story of modern slavery. Around the world, millions of people are living in bondage. They labor in fields and factories under threat of violence if they try to escape. They work in homes for families that keep them virtually imprisoned. They are forced to work as prostitutes or to beg in the streets. Women, men and children of all ages are often held far from home with no money, no connections and no way to ask for help. They discover too late that they've entered a trap of forced labor, sexual exploitation and brutal violence. The United Nations estimates that at least 12 million people worldwide are victims of trafficking. Because they often live and work out of sight, that number is almost certainly too low. More than half of all victims of forced labor are women and girls, compelled into servitude as domestics or sweatshop workers or, like Oxana, forced into prostitution. They face not only the loss of their freedom but also sexual assaults and ! physical abuses. To some, human trafficking may seem like a problem limited to other parts of the world. In fact, it occurs in every country, including the United States, and we have a responsibility to fight it just as others do. The destructive effects of trafficking have an impact on all of us. Trafficking weakens legitimate economies, breaks up families, fuels violence, threatens public health and safety, and shreds the social fabric that is necessary for progress. It undermines our long-term efforts to promote peace and prosperity worldwide. And it is an affront to our values and our commitment to human rights. The Obama administration views the fight against human trafficking, at home and abroad, as an important priority on our foreign policy agenda. The United States funds 140 anti-trafficking programs in nearly 70 countries, as well as 42 domestic task forces that bring state and local authorities together with nongovernmental organizations to combat trafficking. But there is so much more to do.","{'trafficking', 'sexual exploitation', 'violence', 'exploitation'}"

But pensions were not uppermost in their minds. The meeting was a prelude to what senior officials describe as the most sweeping management shake-up in a generation to weed out ineffective supervisors and assign the most aggressive commanders to crime-ridden precincts. Aides to Commissioner William J. Bratton said the meeting was meant to drive home the point that as many as a quarter of the 75 precinct commanders should begin to plan for retirement, prepare themselves psychologically for demotion or search for new jobs outside the force. In an interview Tuesday, Bratton said that while reported felony crimes were down about 10 percent this year from 1993, he was not fully satisfied with the pace at which new police strategies to combat juvenile crime, drugs, illegal gun trafficking and family violence were being put into effect in at least a handful of precincts.

In their first meeting since Pope John Paul II ``definitively'' ruled out the possibility of female ordination, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops are convening in Washington this week, beginning on Nov. 14, for discussions on promoting church leadership and equality for women. Similar issues will confront the members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in debates on the use of inclusive -- or `gender neutral' -- language in certain parts of the liturgy, an area in which past efforts have been stymied by the Vatican and by some clerics in the United States The four-day meeting, which includes representatives from the United States Catholic Conference, the bishops' social policy arm, will also feature discussion of a statement on violence, the presentation of a revised guidebook for Catholic health-care providers, and the first report by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse. The committee's report will make some two dozen recommendations to improve local policies on handling allegations of sexual abuse by clergy and church employees or volunteers, noting that the church should adopt a ``proactive'' rather than defensive response to victims. By focusing on the role of women, the bishops are trying to reach out to the lay and religious women who have devoted much of their time, sometimes their lives, in the service of parishes, schools, hospitals, and other church institutions. The bishops' Committee on Women in Society and in the Church underscored women's many contributions to the church, but they acknowledged in a preliminary draft document that ``persistent sexism'' and the attempts by clergy and lay people to dominate one another is obstructing women's full participation in the church. ``At times this sexism is unconscious, the result of inadequate reflection,'' the bishops wrote in the document titled ``Towards Strengthening the Bonds of Peace.'' ``A church which is deepening its consciousness of itself, which is trying to project the image of Christ to the world, will understand the need for ongoing, prayerful reflection in this area.''","{'violence', 'leadership', 'participation'}"

Joining drug enforcement efforts for the first time, heavily armed Brazilian army soldiers occupied two densely populated hillside shantytowns here Saturday, setting up sandbag gun positions for a campaign against powerful trafficking gangs. The soldiers arrived in olive green helicopters and small tanks under a driving tropical rain. Friday night, the troops had set up checkpoints at entry points to five other shantytowns in Rio's beachfront area. Installed without warning, the barriers cut off weekend drug users from their suppliers in this resort city. The deployment was the greatest show of army force here since the Brazilian military relinquished power to civilians in 1985. Saturday, 50 people were detained in the shantytowns, most of them because they lacked legal documents or were suspected of drug purchases or trafficking, the authorities said. Normally, criminal sweeps in the shantytowns are handled by the state Military Police, who answer only to state governors and are widely feared by residents for their tactics of extortion, intimidation and violence. Twenty years ago, the army was also deeply feared because it repressed urban guerrilla movements with torture and assassinations.

While growing up in a segregated society in the South during the 1940s and 1950s, I lived through the unjust conditions and discrimination forced upon African-Americans and others. Sensing that something was deeply wrong when I was only a child, I longed to join others in an effort to create a better society _ the Beloved Community. My opportunity for making a contribution occurred during the early days of the civil rights movement. Like thousands of other young people, both black and white, I volunteered to engage in nonviolent protest to eliminate segregation. Under considerable moral pressure brought by nonviolent protest and public outcry, the national government dismantled legally sanctioned segregation practiced by many states and localities. Through my participation in the movement, I gained a greater respect and admiration for my country, largely because I witnessed this nation change for the better. My experiences taught me that a strong central government offered the greatest hope to American citizens threatened by local injustice. Since the 1950s and 1960s, I have looked to the federal government as a sympathetic referee in the struggle for social justice. From the great wars to the Great Depression, the federal government has preserved and protected American interests. In the coming years of global economic development and expansion, the American people will likely expect the national government to demonstrate considerable leadership on matters of trade, economic development and environmental protection. In recent years, as an elected official, I have become deeply troubled by efforts of some to diminish the power of the federal government. Sowing the seeds of cynicism about government has created a climate where successful federal programs have come under unnecessary attack. It has also created a climate that has made people more comfortable with their prejudices, and less willing to work together for the common good. Above all, this cynicism has led many to lose their confidence in the national government and its ability to solve problems.","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

518,NYT_ENG_19990604.0340,"EDITORIAL: EUROPE'S NEW MILITARY ASPIRATIONS. The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 5: The air war over Yugoslavia, though successful, brought renewed attention to one of NATO's oldest problems. While 19 countries belong to the alliance and take part in its political decision-making, most of the military power comes from just one of these countries, the United States, as does much of the political leadership. More than two-thirds of the NATO planes used against Serbia were American. This week the European Union, which includes most of NATO's European members, adopted a plan aimed at partially redressing the balance. That is a welcome development. But European governments will have to overcome many obstacles if the plan is to have any practical effect. The idea is to give Europe the ability to carry out peacekeeping and small-scale combat operations on its own, while continuing its reliance on American participation in bigger conflicts. That ability is already improving, at least for peacekeeping. Four years ago in Bosnia, the United States had to provide one-third of the 60,000 peacekeepers. It will be supplying only 14 percent of the 50,000 soldiers planned for Kosovo. The European Union plan, which would unfold over the next 18 months, commits member countries to transform their military forces so that they can be used more effectively in crisis and peacekeeping situations. It also designates a full-time coordinator of European foreign and defense policy, a job given yesterday to Javier Solana, the current secretary-general of NATO. Merely naming a coordinator will not bring coherence to the disparate foreign policies of the European Union's 15 sovereign countries. But Solana's political skills and NATO experience make him a good choice. Europe's total armed forces are already larger than those of the United States.

An unusual coalition of women's groups, family-planning advocates and conservative Republicans is protesting what it describes as the Clinton administration's effort to weaken international laws against the trafficking of women and children for prostitution. In a letter last week, the presidents of the National Organization for Women and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with Gloria Steinem and other feminists, accused the administration of taking a position that was ``extremely detrimental to women'' in negotiations over a new U.N. treaty on sex trafficking. They were referring to the administration's support for wording in the treaty that would define ``forced prostitution'' _ but not other types of prostitution _ as a form of ``sexual exploitation.'' The letter to the State Department said that the wording would make it more difficult to prosecute prostitution rings because the definition ``would not cover some of the most common methods of sex trafficking, which prey on and profit from the economic desperation of women, girls and their families by securing their `consent.''' Leaders of the Heritage Foundation and other politically conservative groups sent a similar letter of protest last week to the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has focused on the issue in her foreign travels and has repeatedly called for a crackdown on all types of trafficking of women and children across international borders.","{'trafficking', 'sexual exploitation', 'exploitation'}"

Charlotte Bunch is an earnest woman with a mission: to build a worldwide network of feminists who will press their local governments to end violence against women, be it genital mutilation in Africa, bride burning in India, honor killing in the Middle East or rape on the battlefields of Bosnia. In certain hands, these are the topics of tabloid television. Picture women in exotic dress, with their backs to the camera, telling lurid tales of abuse. Picture prime-time promos, studded with exclamation marks. Picture early Geraldo, braying outrage. This is not Bunch's way. She makes her case with the measured convolutions of academia and diplomacy, verbal porridge to some but suitable to her position as director of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University and a key player in the movement for international human rights for women. On Sunday, Bunch will lead a symposium at Columbia University on the eve of a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, known as Beijing Plus Five, which will review the progress made since the 1995 World Conference on Women. That conference of 181 nations produced a ``platform for action,'' which women's groups hoped would become an international standard. Bunch's 10-year-old institute trains many of these international feminists in leadership skills and organizing techniques. What may be new to the women of Namibia or Guatemala is old hat to Bunch, who in the 1960s and '70s was quite the firebrand.","{'genital mutilation', 'violence', 'leadership'}"

While families throughout the Western world are happily attending graduation ceremonies for relatives who have completed milestones in their educational careers, some 110 million of the world's children have nothing to celebrate because they never entered school this year. Two-thirds of those uneducated children are girls. That's one reason why the United Nations meeting on women this week, a follow-up to the 1995 Beijing conference, is so important. Giving educational opportunity to girls and women has proven to be the key to lifting living standards and strengthening families. And that includes sex education for young girls. The purpose of the follow-up conference is to expedite action on the goals agreed upon by 189 nations. The most important of those are education for women and girls, ending sexual exploitation and violence against women, providing access to medical care and enhancing job opportunities. To most of us in the Western world, those goals seem innocuous enough. But the Vatican and some conservative Muslim nations have continued to work for removal of the crucial landmark declaration that women have sexual rights independent of men. In closed door meetings in New York, representatives of Algeria, Iran, Libya and Pakistan _ countries with the fewest educational opportunities for women _ tried to weaken the commitment to sexual rights for women and sex education for adolescent girls. You'd think they would be focusing instead on the worldwide prostitution trade that preys on young women from developing nations _ and that is on the rise. Fortunately, it is unlikely those benighted voices will prevail. There is a new generation of women leaders from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia who are insisting on their fundamental human rights. Calling for an end to the tedious debates over what ``access to health care'' means in relation to abortion, Joana Foster, a Zimbabwean who heads Women in Law and Development in Africa, said, ``African women think debates over nuances and language are a waste of time.'' She pointed to women's political gains in Namibia where 44 percent local government system is now comprised of women and new laws have been enacted against female genital mutilation.","{'sexual exploitation', 'violence', 'exploitation', 'genital mutilation'}"

Five years after a watershed conference in Beijing articulated what more than 180 nations agreed were universal rights of women, a weeklong follow-up meeting ended Saturday at the United Nations with no significant victories for opponents who have tried to reverse those gains. An all-night session Friday into Saturday, capping a week of heated arguments, preserved a variety of women's rights including the most contentious, that ``women have the right to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality'' and should be able to do so without ``coercion, discrimination and violence.'' Around the world, this can mean something as basic as choosing a spouse or avoiding customs of genital mutilation. ``I'm very happy that the dire predictions that there would be a rollback have proved false,'' said Angela King, the U.N. official in charge of women's advancement. ``We were determined to get a strong document that did not in any way diminish the gains women had achieved in Beijing,'' she said. ``We were also determined to go beyond Beijing, and we did, despite the efforts of countries that made the process such an arduous one.''","{'genital mutilation', 'violence', 'discrimination'}"

The Senate, as expected, approved harsher punishment Wednesday for people who bring women and children to the United States and force them into prostitution or sweatshop labor. The vote, 95-0, came five days after the House approved the measure, 371-1. The legislation now goes to President Clinton, who has said he will sign it as soon as possible. ``This bill will take immediate action against international sex trafficking, before the lives of more women and girls are shattered,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who was a sponsor of the measure. Though numbers are elusive, government investigators have estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are brought to this country each year by people who promise opportunity but force them into sexual exploitation or involuntary servitude, either in homes or shops. Since many victims are not legal residents and face arrest and deportation if discovered, they are reluctant to seek help from the authorities. As another sponsor, Sen.

Forced labor, slavery and criminal trafficking in people are increasing globally, with women and children most at risk, the International Labor Organization says. Increased efforts are needed to ``stamp out the scourge of forced labor once and for all,'' the labor agency said in a report that examined the issue, which is set for debate by its 175 member nations at an annual meeting next month. Although the report, ``Stopping Forced Labor,'' did not quantify the problem, it said compelled work _ slavery, debt bondage or bonded labor _ was found worldwide. ``The emerging picture is one where slavery, oppression and exploitation of society's most vulnerable members, especially women and children, have by no means been consigned to the past,'' said Juan Somavia, the agency's director general. By far the fastest growing form of forced labor is trafficking in people, which is so pervasive that most nations are either sending, transit or receiving countries, the report said. The workers are sent to richer countries, with the United States believed to be the destination for 50,000 such women and children every year. Most are destined for the sex trade or domestic work. Many from the former Soviet Union end up in Western European sweatshops. Yet traffickers, who are usually part of a criminal network, are rarely caught, and penalties are lighter than for drug smuggling.","{'trafficking', 'domestic work', 'exploitation'}"

King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, who was shot to death on Friday in a massacre of Nepal's royal family, was a proud but isolated monarch whose reign began in absolutism and ended in uneasy partnership with democracy. But it was a uniquely Nepali-style democracy, with a fractious political spectrum from extreme left to right, further muddied by age-old palace intrigue and violence in a royal family, the Shah dynasty, descended from Gurkha warriors that had been in and out of power since the 18th century. King Birendra, 55, had survived a fierce wave of street revolts in 1990 only by the force of tradition; Nepalis considered him a reincarnation of Vishnu, and there was never a mass movement to depose him. But he was later sidelined into the role of constitutional monarch. Nepal was first opened to the world four decades ago by King Mahendra, Birendra's father, and it became the Himalayan region's most popular tourist attraction and the major earner of foreign currency under Birendra. Mountain-climbing feats in the regions around Everest and Annapurna made the country famous among sportsmen and sportswomen. Tourism, however, led to the mushrooming of Katmandu, a city with scant public services that soon became inundated with backpackers and hippies, drawing criticism of uncontrolled tourist growth. Environmental damage marred the slopes of mountains. The reliance on tourism, nurtured by Nepali kings, has not been tempered by the current political leadership.","{'public services', 'violence', 'leadership'}"

The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 23: An abusive military, deadly ethnic and religious violence, police mutinies and aloof presidential leadership are tarnishing the once shining reputation of Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo. Three years ago his election restored democracy to Africa's most populous nation after more than 15 years of corrupt and brutal military rule. Though he has made positive changes, his inability to control army lawlessness and heal the country's divisions have disappointed many Nigerians. Democracy's roots are shallow in Nigeria. Obasanjo must provide more effective leadership for the remainder of his term to ensure its survival. Expectations were extremely and perhaps unrealistically high when Obasanjo took office for the second time, in 1999. Although Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, a succession of military rulers had left its treasury bankrupt, its institutions corrupted and its people demoralized. Obasanjo seemed the most promising candidate to lead a national recovery. In the 1970s he had voluntarily led the military out of government and organized democratic elections. Later he became a fearless critic of military repression, for which he was imprisoned in the late 1990s. In his first months in office Obasanjo restored press freedoms, removed corrupt senior generals, and campaigned against the bribery and kickbacks that had become endemic in Nigerian society. More recently his reform drive has faltered in the face of congressional resistance, and he has proved distressingly tolerant of corruption among his own close political associates. Inexcusably, he has done nothing to halt gross human rights violations by the army against civilians, especially ethnic minorities. Religious divisions have worsened since 12 of the country's 36 states proclaimed Islamic Sharia law, and Obasanjo has appeared virtually helpless in the face of increasingly deadly clashes between members of his own Yoruba ethnic group and the rival Hausas. Government finances are in disarray and public services barely function.","{'public services', 'violence', 'leadership'}"

Thirty years ago when the women's rights movement was just gaining momentum, supporters of male preferences argued that the two sexes couldn't hold jobs together on an equal basis because bathroom facilities for females were inadequate. Surprise: This great barrier to the expansion of opportunities for women was overcome by the brilliant concept of installing additional ladies' rooms. Now it's Title IX of the 1972 law banning sex discrimination in education, especially in intercollegiate sports, that many men find inconvenient. The National Wrestling Coaches Association has filed a lawsuit charging that increasing women's access to sports has created reverse discrimination, forcing some schools to kill minor men's programs like wrestling, gymnastics, swimming and volleyball. The NWC disingenuously blames girls for the lack of institutional support for second-tier male sports that generate little participation and less revenue. There are those who love these sports, including House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach, but there aren't all that many enthusiasts. Fans of college wrestling find it embarrassing to acknowledge the real problem, which is that the sport cannot compete for funds and enthusiasm with big-time games like football and basketball. In their efforts to provide ``proportional'' gender equality, colleges would rather get rid of the minor sports than trim their athletic budgets across the board and diminish the revenue-generating big sports. It was widely reported last week that the Bush administration was about to join the gender wars on the side of male wrestlers, backing away from the rigorous enforcement of Title IX that characterized the Clinton era.

The Supreme Court on Monday took a long-anticipated next step toward defining the limits of congressional power when it agreed to decide whether states are immune from suit for failing to provide equal access to public services by people with disabilities. The justices accepted an appeal by the state of California, which had argued unsuccessfully before a federal appeals court that its state medical board was immune from suit under the Americans With Disabilities Act for refusing to give a mentally ill doctor a license to practice medicine. Last year, the Supreme Court addressed a separate provision of the disabilities law in ruling that states were immune from disability discrimination suits brought by their own employees. That case, in turn, followed an earlier ruling that immunized states from age discrimination suits by their employees. The court has also shielded states from suits by their employees for violations of federal labor law. And later this term, the justices will decide whether states are immune from suits by their employees under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The new case, Medical Board of California v. Hason, No. 02-479, significantly expands the potential impact of the court's federalism revolution. The universe of those who could be affected by the decision goes beyond state employees to include the millions of Americans with disabilities, on whose behalf the law was passed with broad bipartisan support in 1990. At issue is the application to the states of the disability act's Title II, which provides that people with disabilities shall not be discriminated against or ``be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity.''","{'public services', 'participation', 'discrimination'}"

One way or the other, the proposed federal constitutional amendment outlawing gay marriage is likely to be defeated when it comes to a vote in the Senate Wednesday. But we would rather see a clean vote on the merits (or demerits) of this disgraceful idea rather than have it quietly dispatched by a procedural maneuver. A majority of senators -- including both John Kerry and John Edwards as well as several Republicans -- are prepared to vote against amending the Constitution to restrict individual rights for the first time. This is especially laudable considering the political tinge the Bush administration has given the issue, with the president supporting the amendment and even Vice President Dick Cheney, whose daughter is gay, reversing his moderate position from the 2000 campaign. But Tuesday some of the strongest proponents of the gay marriage ban, led by Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, lost the courage of their convictions and pressed the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, to let the amendment die through a cloture vote. Because such a procedural vote is controlled by the leadership, it would likely garner more party-line Republican support than a vote on the issue itself, avoiding an embarrassing rebuke for the White House. Intense negotiations have been under way all week over the form the vote will take on the amendment, which was offered by Colorado Republican Senator Wayne Allard. His proposed language would not simply define marriage as the exclusive privilege of heterosexuals -- discrimination enough -- but could restrict the rights of individual state courts to endorse civil unions or domestic partnership laws. Some Republicans hope to substitute language that simply declares marriage as between a man and a woman and remains mute on other arrangements, again in order to pick up a few more votes. Regardless of these particulars, the marriage amendment would do violence to the Constitution in several ways: It would single out one class of American for discrimination; it would upset the delicate balance of federal and states' rights; and it would impose severe strictures on the judicial branch. Such a narrow -- not to mention narrow-minded -- exception for one kind of civil right does not belong in the nation's declaration of freedoms. Even Americans who oppose gay marriage -- a majority in most polls -- don't think the Constitution should be tampered with to ban it.","{'violence', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

539,NYT_ENG_20050307.0243,"STILL UNEQUAL (FOR USE. STILL UNEQUALTEN YEARS ago in Beijing, a United Nations summit established a set of goals for ending discrimination against women around the world. Among other things, that meant equality for women in education and health care, greater representation of women in government and other decision-making positions, and promotion of human rights, including an end to sex trafficking, coerced marriage, and domestic violence. The conference was notable for establishing that equality for women is not a Western construct foisted upon traditional societies but a universal human right to be observed by every one of the 184 governments that signed the Beijing document. In the 10 years since, progress has surely been made. Life expectancy has gone up and fertility rates have gone down. But though governments have come to accept their obligations toward equality for women and girls, actually implementing these policies in the face of entrenched customs has not been easy. In education, for example, girls still account for 54 percent of the 120 million children not in school; two-thirds of the world's illiterate are women. Yet girls who complete secondary school are more likely to have smaller, healthier families and to contribute to the economic growth of their communities. Closing the gender gap in education is not just a matter of simple equity, in other words, but a crucial investment in the long-term health and development of the world. Education must also include comprehensive sex education. Women need information both about family planning and protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Some of the highest rates of new HIV infections are among women, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. And 500 million women still die every year from pregnancy-related causes. Last week the United States withdrew its obstructionist insistence that the Beijing agreement include a statement that it did not create a new universal right to abortion. The document already makes that clear. But the US delegation at the UN's Beijing-plus-10 conference did reaffirm its commitment to abstinence.

One campaign issue Prime Minister Tony Blair cannot seem to wish away before Britons go to the polls on Thursday is the question of his integrity and credibility before the war in Iraq. On Sunday, Iraq came back to haunt Blair yet again in a newspaper article suggesting that he had committed to a U.S. plan for ""regime change"" months before he told either the Parliament or the people that British participation in the U.S.-led invasion was all but inevitable. The article -- accuracy of which was not immediately challenged by government officials -- could affect Blair's campaign. His opponents may use it renew their assault on his trustworthiness, reviving the charge that Blair secretly promised President Bush to support the invasion of Iraq. Yet, at a rally of the Labor Party faithful on Sunday in this southern coastal town, Blair counterattacked, seeking to transform the debate into a broader question of leadership, and assailing his opponents for what he depicted as their lack of it. In a speech to about 1,000 followers, Blair focused on areas where he says Labor has achieved progress, particularly the economy and public services. His opponents, Blair said, assailed his character and leadership because ""they have nothing else to focus this election on,"" adding, ""They know they have lost the argument"" on the economy and other issues.","{'public services', 'participation', 'leadership'}"

The report, ""A Global Alliance Against Forced Labor,"" estimated that profits from trafficked forced labor totaled $32 billion a year, or $13,000 per trafficked worker. Profits from forced commercial sexual exploitation totaled $27.8 billion annually, or $23,000 per worker.

The good news in Iraq, and that's relative, is that the various secular and religious groups that are vying for participation in a new government are talking. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad has been moving about among the groups and encouraging the sessions to continue until compromise is reached. Obviously, some ground rules agreeable to Iraq's political and religious factions must be established if a democratic government with any stability is to be installed and America can begin to withdraw its troops. Meanwhile, President Bush has begun another of his periodic campaigns to build support for his administration's war policies, in the face of sagging approval of his leadership as indicated by various polls. The third anniversary this weekend of the war's outbreak -- a war that Bush's team apparently thought could be handled quickly and with only a modest U.S. investment -- gives the president an extra incentive to make the case that a successful outcome still can be salvaged. The audiences for his round of speeches will be guaranteed friendly, including organizations that have supported policies under which more than 2,000 American soldiers have died and thousands more have been wounded, while Iraqis have sustained many thousands of casualties. Now, the fear is that civil war may soon break out. Not only would that mean many more additional deaths, but it could undo whatever progress toward democracy has been made. Yesterday, a huge air assault was launched in the northern part of the country, an effort to try to regain control of a war effort hindered by the rivalries and animosities among Iraqi leaders and groups. Their disagreements have been shadowed recently by a steady wave of violence, including reprisal killings, although the White House maintains that Iraq has not descended into civil war.","{'violence', 'leadership', 'participation'}"

Asserting that the federal government had failed to curb gun trafficking, mayors from 15 cities gathered on Tuesday at Gracie Mansion and agreed to intensify efforts to combat illegal firearms. Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Thomas M. Menino of Boston, the organizers of the summit, said the mayors needed to use every tool, from crackdowns on irresponsible gun dealers to new gun-tracing technologies, because federal authorities had abdicated their responsibility. ""It is time for national leadership in the war on gun violence, and if the leadership won't come from Congress or come from the White House, then it has to come from us,"" said Bloomberg, who has made gun violence a signature issue of his second term. ""When Congress does not take the lead on a major problem that affects the whole nation -- whether it's global warming, welfare, immigration -- it's up to the cities and states to do it."" The meeting was the most visible example of Bloomberg's determination to put the gun issue at the forefront of the nation's consciousness. With the city's efforts to combat gun trafficking faltering at the congressional and legal levels, the mayor is working to enlist politicians nationwide in the fight to put pressure on Congress and others to tighten the availability of guns. Menino said that there were 73 homicides last year in Boston, the highest number in a decade, and that shootings were up so far this year. He described gun violence as an epidemic fueled by a ""code of silence"" among fearful residents, the return of former inmates to their neighborhoods, and a growing phenomenon of ""community guns"" used by multiple criminals.","{'trafficking', 'violence', 'leadership'}"

547,NYT_ENG_20061229.0232,"COMMENTARY: THE LAST RACE PROBLEM ORLANDO PATTERSON, A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT HARVARD, IS A GUEST COLUMNIST.. When W.E.B. DuBois, the patrician black leader, predicted in 1903 that the problem of the 20th century would be the color line, he had in mind an ethno-racial problem with a dual character. One side was the near complete exclusion of African-Americans and other minorities from the upper echelons and leadership of American society, public life and national identity. The other was the segregation of blacks from the social, communal and intimate cultural life of white Americans. America's resolution of the public side of the color line would have amazed DuBois. The nation stands today as a global model in the sophistication and enforcement of its civil rights laws, the diversity of its elite, the participation of blacks and other minorities in its great corporations and its public cultural life, and in the embrace of blacks as an integral part of the nation and what it means to be an American. A black man has led the world's most powerful military machine and stood a good chance of winning the presidency on the Republican ticket had he run; another is now a leading challenger for the Democratic nomination. A black woman, Oprah Winfrey, is perhaps the nation's most powerful cultural force; another, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, is one of the world's most powerful people and is the nation's public face before the world. The recent decisive gubernatorial victory of Deval Patrick in Massachusetts is yet another instance of full public integration. And in popular culture, blacks' presence is out of all proportion to their numbers. But when we turn to the other side of DuBois's color line, we find a stunning paradox: accompanying this public integration has been the near complete isolation of blacks from the private life of the white majority. Recent modest improvements notwithstanding, blacks, including the middle class, are nearly as segregated today as they were in DuBois's day. The typical black child now goes to a school that is more segregated than in the late '60s. Segregation is the last major race problem because poverty, per se, is no longer mainly the result of discrimination but part of a broader national crisis that includes whites. Poverty's greater incidence among blacks is largely due to segregation. Compounding the paradox is the fact that the highest metropolitan segregation rates are now in the ""liberal"" regions of the Northeast and the Midwest, including New York. The paradox deepens when we learn from repeated polls that whites say they are comfortable living in neighborhoods that are approximately 25 percent black.","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

A federal crackdown on drug dealers has succeeded in taking some of Boston's most dangerous offenders off the streets, but it is also driving some dealers and gang leaders to pursue another line of criminal work: prostitution.

""The girl has become the new drug,"" said Kelley O'Connell, a sergeant detective who runs the Boston Police Department's human trafficking unit, which has been working with the drug unit to track dealers who may have turned to prostitution. The trend is in part a consequence of the comparative ease of sexual exploitation in the digital age. Pimps can advertise girls and women online - a way both to increase demand and avoid street arrests. But the department's more aggressive use of tough federal drug laws to target gangs and so-called impact players - those police believe to be involved in shootings - has also sent a message that criminals should consider another path, according to police officials and some community leaders.

Those who need a break from the romantic travails of Bella Swan -- and who like a best-seller-list tie-in for their moviegoing -- will welcome the release of ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" the second installment in the Swedish trilogy based on Stieg Larsson's novels. Hollywood remakes are not far off, but what Anglophone actress could match the intense rightness of Noomi Rapace for the role of Lisbeth Salander? Ellen Page? Carey Mulligan (listed as ""rumored"" on the IMDB website)? Miley Cyrus? Larsson's ""Girl"" books (including the last one, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" which was recently published in the United States) may not be great literature, but it would be foolish to deny that Lisbeth is a terrifically compelling character. She embodies so many cultural fantasies and anxieties that it is hard to imagine anyone who could resist her magnetism. Antisocial and deeply principled, a computer nerd with lethal fists, a chain-smoking sexual athlete and merciless scourge of sexual predators, Lisbeth elicits disparate instincts in viewers (and in some of her fellow characters) that are less contradictory than mutually reinforcing. Do you want to protect her? Sleep with her? Hang out with her? Or be just like her? By ""you"" I mean primarily Mikael Blomkvist, the muckraking, bed-hopping journalist who is Lisbeth's confidant and alter ego, and the conduit between her inscrutability and the audience's desire to know her better. Mikael, as played by Michael Nyqvist, is as open in his demeanor as Lisbeth is secretive, although he also frequently operates by means of indirection and outright deceit. The two of them -- Watson and Holmes; Nick and Nora Charles; Robin and Batman -- unravel grim conspiracies involving powerful men and poke at the underbelly of modern society, where misogyny, political authority and capitalist greed fester and commingle. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" directed by Niels Arden Oplev, was a serviceable but not terribly inspired cinematic introduction to Mikael and Lisbeth's world, seriously marred by literal-minded depictions of violence that blurred the line between provocation and prurience. The sequel, directed by Daniel Alfredson, is no less concerned with cruelty to women (the original title of the first book is ""Men Who Hate Women"") -- and no less outraged by the extent to which sexual exploitation goes unpunished -- but does not need to assault (or titillate) the audience to make its point.","{'sexual exploitation', 'violence', 'exploitation'}"

Indian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a historic bill that would set aside one- third of all legislative seats for women, a move aimed at overturning six decades of male-dominated decision-making in this country. The bill, which drew fierce opposition before its passage in the upper house of parliament, would guarantee seats for women in the national legislature and all state assemblies in the world's largest democracy, where women have been largely kept on the sidelines of the legislative process. The bill must still be passed by the lower house of parliament. It is expected to pass, although analysts say opponents could use political maneuvers to delay the bill. ""This is a momentous development in the long journey of empowering our women. Women are facing discrimination at home, there is domestic violence, unequal access to health and education. This has to end,"" India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said after legislators approved the bill Tuesday. The new quotas, he said, will be ""living proof that the heart of Indian democracy is sound and is in the right place.""

Runs Afoul of the Constitution. The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: Picture this: gay student organizations forced to accept those who believe that homosexuality is an abomination. Student political groups, such as Young Republicans or Young Democrats, compelled to allow members of the other party to vote on policy platforms. A law association for African American students being told that it must let white supremacists run for leadership posts. Sound absurd? Welcome to the University of California, Hastings College of Law. The school says that student groups that want to enjoy certain benefits must adhere to the school's nondiscrimination policy. Fair enough, except that the school's ""all comers"" policy requires that a group accept as voting members even those who disagree with its core principles. Organizations that comply gain the right to use campus meeting rooms and school e-mail lists and are invited to the annual student organization fair. They also have the right to apply for grants funded by student activity fees and vending machine sales. The school lists about 60 such ""recognized school organizations,"" including the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students, the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association and Hastings Outlaw, a group founded by gay students. The Christian Law Society (CLS) is not among them. Although it allows all Hastings students to attend meetings, CLS reserves voting membership and leadership posts for those who sign a declaration of faith that includes belief in Jesus Christ. The group asserts that ""in the view of the clear dictates of Scripture, unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle is inconsistent with an affirmation of the Statement of Faith, and consequently may be regarded by CLS as disqualifying such an individual from CLS membership."" What CLS considers as disqualifying are ""all acts of sexual conduct outside of God's design for marriage between one man and one woman, which acts include fornication, adultery, and homosexual conduct.""","{'participation', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

Forty-seven years ago this weekend, on a sweltering August day often remembered simply as the March on Washington, my father delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial. A memorial to him is being erected at the Tidal Basin, not far from where he shared his vision of a nation united in justice, equality and brotherhood. This weekend Glenn Beck is to host a ""Restoring Honor"" rally at the Lincoln Memorial. While it is commendable that this rally will honor the brave men and women of our armed forces, who serve our country with phenomenal dedication, it is clear from the timing and location that the rally's organizers present this event as also honoring the ideals and contributions of Martin Luther King Jr. I would like to be clear about what those ideals are. Vast numbers of Americans know of my father's leadership in opposing segregation. Yet too many believe that his dream was limited to achieving racial equality. Certainly he sought that objective, but his vision was about more than expanding rights for a single race. He hoped that even in the direst circumstances, we could overcome our differences and replace bitter conflicts with greater understanding, reconciliation and cooperation. My father championed free speech. He would be the first to say that those participating in Beck's rally have the right to express their views. But his dream rejected hateful rhetoric and all forms of bigotry or discrimination, whether directed at race, faith, nationality, sexual orientation or political beliefs. He envisioned a world where all people would recognize one another as sisters and brothers in the human family. Throughout his life he advocated compassion for the poor, nonviolence, respect for the dignity of all people and peace for humanity.","{'violence', 'discrimination', 'leadership'}"

566,WPB_ENG_20101218.0003,"A Chance For Democracy in Egypt. Although it has held a series of troubling elections this year, Egypt has an opportunity to fulfill the commitments its government has made to the Egyptian people as it prepares for next year's presidential election, if it takes steps to implement several changes to which it has committed. Most reports show voter turnout in the recent parliamentary elections was less than 25 percent - reflecting Egyptians' lack of faith in their electoral process. Ongoing public demonstrations reinforce this fact. Indeed, in both rounds of parliamentary elections there were credible reports of significant government interference directed against voters at the ballot box. Opposition party observers and candidate representatives were blocked from polling places, domestic monitors were denied full access to observe the process, and international monitors were not allowed into the country. The June elections for Egypt's upper house of parliament were similarly troubled. Both Egyptian elections stand in contrast to a trend in the region of greater electoral transparency. Iraq and Jordan also held elections this year, and both allowed independent international and domestic monitors to observe the voting process. While irregularities and some violence were reported in each of those elections, the relative freedom and transparency of their processes underscore the extent to which some leaders in the region are embracing international norms for democratic elections as a way to increase public participation and confidence in their governments. President Obama has made clear his support for the principle that all individuals should have the chance to shape the decisions that affect their lives. The United States, along with many other governments - including some in the Middle East, as evidenced by the Iraqi and Jordanian elections - embraces the globally accepted norm of international monitoring for democratic elections. These are universal principles, as valid for the Middle East as for Africa, Asia or North America. The partnership between the United States and Egypt, one of our most important in the region, is rooted in common interests and shared aspirations. Both Americans and Egyptians want to achieve Arab-Israeli peace and hope to see a stable Iraq and an Iran that behaves responsibly within the international community. It is the administration's firm view that progress in political and economic reform in Egypt is essential to the country's long-term strength and success as a regional leader as well as to sustaining a strong foundation for our valued strategic partnership. The presidential elections scheduled for next fall present Egypt's leadership with an opportunity to set the stage for the future by making the reforms that will bolster citizens' confidence in their government and enhance the government's legitimacy in the eyes of the international community.","{'violence', 'leadership', 'participation'}"

Bellamy said it is an outrage when those who commit such crimes are openly admired in their communities and are subjected to only token prosecution. Although these crimes are unacceptable to the public in virtually all countries, the practices persist, even where there are legal prohibitions, Bellamy said. Bellamy said these crimes, along with the forced marriage, involuntary virginity tests, female genital mutilation, trafficking and forced prostitution, are egregious violations of girls' and women's rights, based on outmoded and unjust cultural norms.","{'trafficking', 'forced marriage', 'violence', 'genital mutilation'}"

The United Nations has convened four world conferences on women in the past quarter of a century which have been instrumental in elevating the cause of gender equality to the very center of the global agenda and have united the international community behind a set of common objectives with an effective plan of action for the advancement of women everywhere, in all spheres of public and private life. The Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in September 1995 in Beijing, China, is regarded as a new chapter in the struggle for gender equality. It brought about a new international commitment to the goals of gender equality, development and peace for all women and moved the global agenda for the advancement of women into the twenty-first century. The fundamental transformation that took place at the Beijing Conference was the recognition of the need to shift the focus from women to the concept of gender, recognizing that the entire structure of society, and all relations between men and women within it, had to be re-evaluated. This change represented a strong reaffirmation that women's rights were human rights and that gender equality was an issue of universal concern, benefiting all. The legacy of the Beijing Conference was that it sparked a renewed global commitment to the empowerment of women everywhere and drew unprecedented international attention. The Conference unanimously adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, that was in essence an agenda for women's empowerment and stands as a milestone for the advancement of women in the twenty- first century. The Platform for Action specified twelve critical areas of concern considered to represent the main obstacles to women's advancement, which required concrete action by Governments and civil society: women and poverty; education and training of women; women and health; violence against women; women and armed conflict; women and the economy; women in power and decision-making; institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women; human rights of women; women and the media; women and the environment; and the girl child.","{'decision-making', 'violence', 'gender equality'}"

Building on work done in Brunei last year, we have made further progress by formulating and delivering a long-term, forward-looking and more action-oriented e-APEC Strategy for the development of the New Economy through the promotion of information and communications technology (ICT) and its application in our region. The goal is to build APEC towards a digital society, with higher growth, increased learning and employment opportunities, improved public services and better qualities of life by taking advantage of advanced, reliable and secure ICT and networks and by promoting universal access. Such a society should bring equal opportunities and widely shared benefits for all member economies and individuals, including women, the disabled and others. We commend the crosscutting character of the e-APEC Strategy and urge APEC fora and member economies to implement the programs for collective and individual actions set out in the Strategy, as appropriate. Under the current circumstances, the early implementation of the Strategy will also support the revival of the ICT sector. We also welcome the progress in advancing e-commerce. 16. In September 2002 many of us will be meeting in Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to reinvigorate our commitment to sustainable development in pursuit of enhancing economic growth, promoting human and social development and protecting the environment as interdependent objectives. We will consider how APEC, which has undertaken a broad range of activities in this area, can contribute to the success of the World Summit and take forward the outcomes in its work program. 17. We realize that there is an ongoing public debate on the benefits and costs of globalization. Such debates are healthy when they are informed by rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the impact of globalization. The time has come for APEC to come forward and lead the public debate in a constructive manner. We instruct Officials to convene an APEC Dialogue on Globalization and Shared Prosperity, focusing on, among other issues, structural adjustment and its impact. At the same time, APEC should reach out to business and other stakeholders to communicate APEC's objectives, activities and benefits to ensure that they participate in and benefit from the APEC process and globalization at large. In particular, we thank APEC Business Advisory Council ( ABAC) for its report and value the interaction with the Council and other business representatives. We also direct our Ministers and Officials to develop and implement programs to give effect to the APEC Communications and Outreach Strategy as well as the conclusions of the Ad Hoc Group on APEC Interaction. 18. Noting that sustainable growth in the APEC region also requires the ability to feed a growing and increasingly prosperous population, Leaders call for accelerated implementation of the APEC Food System initiative.

Political Development and Restructuring Developing socialist democracy and establishing a socialist political civilization are an important goal for building a well- off society in an all-round way. Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, we must go on steadily and surely with political restructuring, extend socialist democracy and improve the socialist legal system in order to build a socialist country under the rule of law and consolidate and develop the political situation characterized by democracy, solidarity, liveliness, stability and harmony. Our Party has always deemed it its duty to realize and develop people's democracy. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, we have pressed on with political restructuring and improved socialist democracy. The key to developing socialist democracy is to combine the need to uphold the Party's leadership and to ensure that the people are the masters of the country with the need to rule the country by law. Leadership by the Party is the fundamental guarantee that the people are the masters of the country and that the country is ruled by law. The people being the masters of the country constitutes the essential requirement of socialist democracy. Ruling the country by law is the basic principle the Party pursues while it leads the people in running the country. The CPC is the core of leadership for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Governance by the Communist Party means that it leads and supports the people in acting as the masters of the country and mobilizes and organizes them on a most extensive scale to manage state and social affairs and economic and cultural undertakings according to law, safeguarding and realizing their fundamental interests. The Constitution and other laws embody the unity of the Party's views and the people's will. All organizations and individuals must act in strict accordance with the law, and none of them are allowed to have the privilege to overstep the Constitution and other laws. Political restructuring is the self-improvement and development of the socialist political system. It must help enhance the vitality of the Party and state, demonstrate the features and advantages of the socialist system, give full scope to the initiative and creativity of the people, safeguard national unity, ethnic solidarity and social stability and promote economic development and social progress. We must always proceed from our national conditions, review our experience gained in practice and at the same time learn from the achievements of political civilization of mankind. We should never copy any models of the political system of the West. We must concentrate on institutional improvement and ensure that socialist democracy is institutionalized and standardized and has its procedures. 1. Uphold and improve the systems of socialist democracy. It is essential to improve the systems of democracy, develop diverse forms of democracy, expand citizens' participation in political affairs in an orderly way, and ensure that the people go in for democratic elections and decision-making, exercise democratic management and supervision according to law and enjoy extensive rights and freedoms, and that human rights are respected and guaranteed. We should uphold and improve the system of people's congresses and ensure that the congresses and their standing committees exercise their functions according to law and that their legislation and policy decisions better embody the people's will. We should optimize the composition of the standing committees. We should uphold and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party. We should uphold the principle of ""long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all sincerity and sharing weal and woe"", step up our cooperation with the democratic parties and better display the features and advantages of the Chinese socialist system of political parties. We will ensure that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) plays its role in political consultation, democratic supervision and participation in and deliberation of state affairs. We will consolidate and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front. We will fully implement the Party 's policy toward ethnic minorities, uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, consolidate and enhance socialist ethnic relations of equality, solidarity and mutual assistance and promote common prosperity and progress for all our ethnic groups. We will implement the Party's policy toward the freedom of religious belief, handle religious affairs according to law, encourage the adaptability of religions to the socialist society and uphold the principle of self-administration and running religious affairs independently.

""Trade policies impact on gender relations and human development by rearranging relations of power and access to resources between women and men. If trade policies are assumed to be gender discriminatory, they may reproduce or even worsen current forms of inequality and discrimination against women in all countries,"" it said.

Since the goals set in the Outline for the  Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000) have been basically  realized, and to meet the demands of China's coordinated economic  and social development and the requirements of the UN Millennium  Development Goals, China promulgated in 2001 its Outline for the  Development of Chinese Women (2001-2010). The new document  outlines 34 major goals and 100 policies and measures in six  fields: women and the economy; women's participation in  decision-making and administration; women and education; women and health; women and the law; and women and the environment. The  departments concerned under the State Council and local  governments at all levels have all worked out their own programs  for the implementation of the outline and plans for women's  development in their respective areas. The National Working Committee on Children and Women (NWCCW)  under the State Council, the coordination and consultation organ  of the Chinese government in charge of women and children's work,  plays an important role in coordinating and promoting relevant  government departments to do women and children's work well, as  well as in formulating and organizing the implementation of the  outlines for the development of women and children, providing  necessary human, financial and material resources to the work on  women and children and to the development of women and children's  cause, and guiding, encouraging and supervising the work of its  subordinates in all provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities directly under the central government.

In working harder to reform and improve the government, we must always put people first and run the government for the people, and take fulfilling, safeguarding and developing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as both our starting point and objective. We must proceed from China's actual conditions and fully integrate the leadership of the Party, the people's position as the masters of the country and the running of the government according to the rule of law. We must constantly improve the socialist market economy and promote comprehensive, balanced and sustainable economic and social development. We must make innovations in the systems and means of government administration, and increase transparency and public participation in government affairs. Our objective is to build a just, transparent, hard-working, efficient, honest, upright and clean government that follows a well-defined code of conduct, a government with which the people are satisfied. For some time to come, we need to work to standardize government powers, adjust and optimize government structure and the division of responsibility, improve the methods used to administer government affairs and deliver services, actively take steps to make administrative affairs more open, accelerate the development of e-government and government websites, improve the overall quality of civil servants, comprehensively increase administrative efficiency and strengthen the public's trust in the government. All these efforts have one main purpose, namely, to transform the way the government functions. This year we will focus on the following three tasks. One is to improve the macroeconomic regulatory system, continue the work of separating government administration from enterprise management, and deepen reform of the administrative examination and approval system to reduce the number of items subject to administrative examination and approval and improve efficiency. Two is to improve public administration and public services, increase the government's ability to provide basic public services and strive to resolve the issues of greatest concern to the people. Three is to standardize administrative actions in accordance with the law, work hard to build a clean government and combat corruption, and improve the system for punishing and preventing corruption that combines education, regulation and oversight. We will work vigorously to improve the government's work style. One important task we are now facing is to deal with the serious problem of extravagance and waste in some government bodies.

Discrimination against and marginalization of prostitutes limits their access to good quality health services, particularly for the detection and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, a UN official has warned. Ndolamb Ngokwey, coordinator of the United Nations System in Mozambique, said this on Wednesday when speaking at the opening of a regional conference on HIV/AIDS and sex trade in Maputo. He said discrimination drove prostitutes into working clandestinely, and thus without proper access to health care. Cultural attitudes towards gender, stigma and discrimination, the precarious nature of their work, including the risk of violence, all helped make prostitutes to be vulnerable to HIV infection, he added. Ngokwey said, ""To block the spread of HIV/AIDS, the actions of everyone are crucial. We cannot remain silent."" The response of the United Nations to the pandemic,he added, ""is guided by the principle of protection and respect for human rights, such as the rights to health, freedom and security, and protection from exploitation and abuse."" ""Taking into account that throughout the world in most cases HIV is transmitted sexually, the relation between the sex trade and HIV/AIDS is a fundamental concern in prevention and care efforts,"" stressed Ngokwey.","{'violence', 'discrimination', 'exploitation'}"
783,XIN_ENG_20071114.0459,"Full Text: China's Political Party System (7). The value and functions of China's multi-party cooperation system are manifested as follows: -- Political participation.  The multi-party cooperation system opens up an institutionalized channel for the political participation of democratic parties, incorporates various social forces into the political system, and consolidates and expands the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship; mobilizes the enthusiasm of all sectors, pools the wisdom of the people, solicits proposals widely, and promotes the scientific and democratic decision-making of the ruling party and the government; and advances the positive and steady development of socialist democracy on the premise of maintaining social stability. -- Expression of interests.  China is a large, populous country with a variety of social classes, strata and groups. On the basis of common fundamental interests, differences and contradictions in specific interests exist among the people. In particular, as the socialist market economy progresses, the reform of the economic system deepens, the social structure and the pattern of interests undergo great reshuffles, and people's ideas also change profoundly. The multi- party cooperation system can effectively reflect the interests, wishes and demands of all social sectors, clears and broadens the channels for the expression of interest, coordinates interest relations, gives due consideration to the interests of allies, and thus maintains social harmony and stability. -- Social integration.  China's arduous and complicated modernization task requires a political system that has a strong function in social integration. Combining the firm leadership of the CPC with extensive cooperation with democratic parties, the multi-party cooperation system has forged a mighty power of social integration. Aiming at the paramount objective of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC cooperates closely with democratic parties, creates strong political identification, facilitates optimized allocation of political resources, mobilizes the enthusiasm of all sectors, and leads and organizes the society to move continuously toward modernization. -- Democratic supervision.  Mutual supervision between the CPC and the democratic parties is conducive to strengthening the supervision function within the system and avoiding various drawbacks arising from lack of supervision. The democratic parties represent specific interests and demands of relevant groups of people, reflect complaints and suggestions from all walks of life, and provide all-round supervision apart from the self-supervision of the CPC. This facilitates the scientific and democratic decision-making of the ruling party, so that it will resist and overcome bureaucracy and all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena more consciously, thus reinforcing and improving the work of the ruling party in all aspects.","{'participation', 'leadership', 'decision-making'}"

Delegates to the Inter- Parliamentary Union  (IPU)'s 120th Assembly on Wednesday urged for accelerated progress in protecting the rights of adolescent girls and ending gender discrimination. ""Addressing discrimination and promoting the well-being and empowerment of adolescent girls is not only a question of human rights and gender equality, it is also at the core of development and achieving the Millennium Development Goals,"" said IPU president Theo-Ben Gurirab. He said that gender-based discrimination permeates all of our societies, with no exception, and people need to address that as a matter of urgency. Among those most affected, though often forgotten and invisible, are adolescent girls. Gender-based discrimination and gender inequalities, often passed on from generation to generation by cultural tradition and economic, social and political norms, have numerous harmful effects on adolescent girls, according to the IPU. In many parts of the world the largest percentage of children out of school and of victims of physical, sexual, emotional abuse and economic exploitation are girls. Girls are more likely to be trafficked, to disappear or to die unknown, a press release from the IPU said.","{'discrimination', 'exploitation', 'gender equality'}"

862,XIN_ENG_20101212.0056,"Nepali gov't allows women to work in Gulf countries. Nepali government has recently approved Terms of Reference (TOR) prepared by the Ministry of Labor and Transport Management (MoLTM) paving way for Nepali women to work as domestic helpers in Gulf countries. According to Monday's Republica daily, the MoLTM had prepared this TOR based on recommendations of the high-level taskforce led by joint secretary Purna Chandra Bhattarai. Earlier, irrespective of the Foreign Employment Act-2007 that envisages equal opportunities for male and female jobseekers, there was a virtual ban on Nepali women to work in Gulf countries. As a result, they had been resorting to illegal means to migrate to Gulf countries. Many of them even ended up being victims of sexual exploitation and physical tortures at the hands of their employers. ""There were several restrictions,"" said Bhattarai, adding, ""And they had been migrating to gulf countries through various illegal channels. Now, they can go to any Gulf country through a legal process. This TOR is all about managing safe migration of Nepali women to the Gulf."" As per this TOR, Nepali women can go to Gulf countries through legal manpower agencies. However, before sending them to the Gulf, these agencies must ensure that Nepali embassies in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates certify the demand for Nepali women workers. ""If our embassies say there is no demand, manpower agencies will not be allowed to send Nepali women workers to the Gulf,"" Bhattarai said.","{'sexual exploitation', 'exploitation', 'equal opportunities'}"
