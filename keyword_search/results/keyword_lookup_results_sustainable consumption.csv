CNA_ENG_20080516.0038,"Taiwan's recycling shines on international stage. Taiwan's recycling efforts have become a model for the international community, with its recycling rate of 38.3 percent higher than the 33-34 percent common in European and American countries, an official said Friday. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Winston Dang said the EPA has raised public awareness of the importance of resource recycling and set up the Recycling Fund Management Board in 1998 to manage recycling  in Taiwan  and raise the country's performance in the field. The EPA has also promoted the importance of resource recycling at educational institutions and set up recycling stations in public places,  including gas stations, bus stations,  airports,  and recreational areas, to achieve greater recycling efficiency. Those efforts have turned recycling into an NT$100 billion-a-year (US$3.23 billion) industry, Dang said at an award ceremony to honor individuals and communities that have made major contributions to environmental protection. He called on the public to make recycling an important part of their daily routine to do even better, and he also encouraged the younger generation to live based on the principle that everybody has a responsibility to protect their living environment.","{'recycling', 'awareness', 'efficiency'}",0.2049258736967519
NYT_ENG_20020312.0012,"IN NEW YORK CITY, DOING WELL TRUMPS DOING GOOD. A lot of the 1970s seems pretty remote these days. The Led Zeppelin records gather dust. High-mileage economy cars and low thermostats to conserve energy have given way to cheap gasoline and sport utility vehicles. Afros and ``Have a Nice Day'' buttons are the stuff of camp and kitsch. But recycling lives on. From its early roots after the first Earth Day in 1970, when parking lot recycling centers began popping up, reuse became the middle-American expression of environmental awareness. Recycling, its supporters believed, was a tiny lever that could work its way into the average American household _ and consciousness _ and through repetition and habit forge the realization that throwaway culture has its costs, that packaging matters, and that using less is probably a good thing. Mayor Michael Bloomberg now says recycling is rather more earthbound than that: It's about making the budget numbers work. Some recycling makes sense, specifically paper, which generates revenue for New York City, he said. But glass, metal and plastic recycling costs money, and under the mayor's budget plan is to be dropped, perhaps to be brought back when New York can better afford it. Few people dispute Bloomberg's assertion that tough times demand tough choices. But to a great degree, experts in consumer behavior say, the mayor's proposal _ and the anguished reaction that some people have had to it _ also says a lot about the long strange trip that recycling has been through over the years.","{'recycling', 'reuse', 'awareness'}",0.14736623807867796

XIN_ENG_20070322.0231,"UN chief calls for integrated management of water resources. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday called on member states to boost international cooperation on integrated management of the world's scarce water resources. ""The state of the world's waters remains fragile, and the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to water resource management is as pressing as ever,"" Ban said in a message marking World Water Day which falls on Thursday. Available supplies are under great duress as a result of high population growth, unsustainable consumption patterns, poor management practices, pollution, inadequate investment in infrastructure and low efficiency in water-use, he noted. ""Yet even more water will be needed in the future: to grow food, to provide clean drinking water and sanitation services, to operate industries and to support expanding cities. The water- supply-demand gap is likely to grow wider still, threatening economic and social development and environmental sustainability,"" he said. With some 700 million people around the world currently suffering from water scarcity, a figure that could increase to more than 3 billion by 2025, integrated cross-border management of this vital resource is crucial, he said.","{'sustainable consumption', 'efficiency', 'sustainability'}",0.05356228012207831

XIN_ENG_20071118.0063,"Experts seek ""green solution"" to garbage disposal in Beijing. Finding a ""green solution"" for the disposal of Beijing's garbage in the run-up to next year's Olympic Games was a hot topic over the weekend as environmental experts discussed methods to improve the capital's waste management efficiency. ""We must mobilize the whole society to counter garbage pollution so as to create a green Beijing Olympic Games,"" said Dong Suocheng, a senior official with the China Society of Natural Resources, at the forum held on Sunday. To ease garbage pollution, citizens need to raise their awareness of environmental protection and change their lifestyle and consumption habits so as to reduce total waste output, the famed environmental conservation scholar said. In addition, the garbage processing industry has to be developed in a more scientific way. Statistics released at the forum revealed China's urban solid waste storage volume had exceeded seven billion tons and occupied a storage area as large as 600 million square meters. About 250 million tons of garbage are collected from more than 600 Chinese cities annually and the volume is increasing by eight to ten percent each year. More than 200 cities also suffer from ""garbage pollution"", a term referring to waste that cannot be recycled.","{'waste management', 'awareness', 'efficiency'}",0.04791234276920245
XIN_ENG_20060604.0213,"Full text: Environmental Protection in China (1996-2005) (7). -- Developing a cyclical economy. The first step is to engage  in clean production by making full use of resources at the  beginning and throughout the whole production process in an  enterprise, so as to minimize, reuse or render harmless the waste  matter; to gradually establish a producer's responsibility system  and extend it to cover the designing phase to promote  ecologically-friendly product design. So far, over 5,000  enterprises in the sectors of chemicals, light industry,  power-generating, coal, machinery, and building materials have  passed the examination for clean production. More than 12,000  enterprises across China have received the ISO14000 Environmental  Management System certification. More than 800 enterprises and  over 18,000 products of diverse types and specifications have  received environmental labeling certification. Their annual output value is worth 60 billion yuan. The second step is that ecological industry is being vigorously developed in industry-concentrated  areas so that wastes from upstream enterprises become raw  materials for enterprises downstream. This has effectively  extended the production chain, minimized the amount of waste and  realized zero emission. Besides, ecological industrial zones have  been established and resources are being used in the most  efficient way within these zones or among enterprises. At present, 17 ecological industrial parks of different kinds have been set up nationwide. The third step is to make overall plans for the  development of industry and agriculture, production and  consumption, city and countryside. This involves vigorously  developing industries that make cyclical use of resources, so as  to realize sustainable production and consumption. The State has  conducted the first pilot cyclical economy program in 82  enterprises in some of the key industries, fields or industrial  parks, and in concerned provinces and municipalities. A pilot  scheme is being carried out in 24 cities, including Beijing and  Shanghai, to establish a recycling system of renewable resources.  Hainan, Jilin, Heilongjiang and six other provinces are actively  engaged in building themselves into ecological provinces, and some 150 cities and counties into ecological cities and counties.

The Chinese government has established a system of compulsory government procurement of energy-saving products, actively advocating energy-saving (including water- saving) products as a priority for government procurement; and included some products with outstanding results and stable performance on the list of compulsory procurement. It will give full play to the role of governmental purchase in policy guidance and in encouraging all sectors of society to produce and use energy-saving products. It will study and formulate fiscal and taxation policies to encourage energy conservation, implement preferential taxation policies for those effectively making comprehensive use of resources, and set up an energy-saving mechanism with multi-channel financing. It will deepen the reform of energy prices to introduce a pricing mechanism favorable for energy conservation. It will put in force an evaluation and examination system in respect of energy conservation in fixed assets investment projects and strictly control increase of energy consumption at the roots. It will set up a new energy-conservation mechanism for enterprises, adopt an energy efficiency labeling mechanism, and promote contract-based energy management and voluntary energy-conservation agreements. It will improve the legal framework regarding energy conservation, and strengthen energy-conservation management by law. It will improve the overall quality of energy-conservation managerial personnel, and step up efforts in law enforcement, supervision and examination. -- Advocating energy conservation in society.

NYT_ENG_20000204.0266,"Mohawk to buy plastic bottles from Coke bottler, turn them into. Mohawk Industries has inked a large deal with Coca-Cola Enterprises to buy its recycled plastic bottles in the Northeast. Calhoun, Ga.-based Mohawk, one of the world's largest recyclers of plastic, will turn the bottles into polyester carpet at its plant in Summerville, Ga. Mohawk said it jumped on an exclusive contract with CCE, the largest Coca-Cola bottler, to help offset the effect of a recently expanded recycling law in California. California, one of 10 states with bottle deposit laws, broadened its law Jan. 1 to include most plastic containers. Previously, California's ``bottle bill'' primarily covered carbonated soft drink bottles made with polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. Many U.S. plastics recyclers get their bottles from California, which collected about 100 million pounds of PET last year. Now, some recyclers are concerned that plastics that aren't properly sorted will contaminate loads of PET and raise processing costs. ``We got this contract as insurance that we'd have a clean stream of bottles,'' said Phil Cavin, Mohawk's national director of procurement. He didn't disclose financial terms of the one-year Northeastern contract, which effectively equals the amount of recycled bottles Mohawk previously bought from California. He added that Mohawk buys bottles from all over the United States and Canada, mainly from state organizations or waste management companies.","{'waste management', 'procurement', 'recycling'}",0.04335195336185724
NYT_ENG_20050704.0206,"TRASH REMOVAL GOAL MIGHT BE DUMPED. The amount of trash produced by Massachusetts residents has been steadily increasing over the last decade, forcing state officials to back away from a key waste management goal and generating a need for landfill space to handle the overflow of garbage. Draconian cuts to the state's recycling budget and residents' apparent ability to generate ever more waste have contributed to the state exporting more than 1.5 million tons of garbage every year. By 2012, that figure is expected to reach 3 million tons. The state is so far behind a goal to have enough disposal capacity to take care of all the trash that residents produce by 2006, officials are preparing to announce they are abandoning it. ""We need a place to take the trash,"" said Jim Colman, assistant commissioner for waste prevention for the state Department of Environmental Protection. In 1992, each Massachusetts resident produced, on average, about 2.54 pounds of trash per day. Today, that is up to 3 pounds per person. ""If more people recycled, reduced, and reused, clearly there would be less need for landfills,"" Colman said. Massachusetts lifted a moratorium on new landfills five years ago, and in the last two years there have been about a dozen proposals to build landfills near operating or former dumps around the state. Those proposals have touched off a number of community controversies. In Hardwick, residents are battling a proposal that could more than double the size of a private landfill in town, a bitter fight that already has cost one selectman his position. The state Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments in March over a state- and town-approved plan to allow a Granby landfill operator to pile the mound more than 75 feet higher with trash. Templeton officials agreed to reopen a landfill but then reversed course after opposition from residents last year. Fall River has taken its battle against a state-approved private landfill expansion to court.","{'waste management', 'reuse', 'recycling'}",0.042881005419275135
