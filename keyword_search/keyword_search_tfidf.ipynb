Republican lawmakers, resisting a White House request to lift the minimum wage for US employees, on Wednesday unveiled their own plan to help the working poor. The issue has emerged as a hot political topic in this presidential election year, with the Democratic White House and its allies in Congress pushing for a 90-cent increase in the 4.25 dollar minimum wage. Feeling the pressure, Republican leaders proposed their own plan -- but it would not raise the minimum wage. Instead, they would restructure a current program that gives income tax rebates to poor families earning the minimum wage. Under the proposal single workers earning the wage -- which, at 8,840 dollars per year is just above the poverty level for one person -- would receive no tax rebates while poor families would see the amounts they currently receive go up. Representative Dick Armey, majority leader of the Republican- controlled House of Representatives, said the plan would \"improve the well-being of low income workers without destroying job opportunities.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Full Text: Wang Chen: China Registers Historic Progress in Human\\nRights (5). Q. Great changes have taken place in the present-day international human rights. How do you view the present situation in this field? How do you think the world human rights cause can develop healthily? A. There are two prominent features in the current international human rights situation. One is that the international community has never attached such great importance to human rights as at present and human rights have become an important subject in international exchange and cooperation. Since the end of the Cold War, human rights issues have become increasingly important in international relations and international politics. With the rapid growth of economic globalization and informationization of social life, countries have become increasingly inter-dependent and mutually cooperative, thus accentuating the importance of human rights issues. Countries have attached more and more importance to human rights issues and reached more and more common understanding on these issues. In March 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, deciding to set up the Human Rights Council under it to replace the Human Rights Commission affiliated to the UN Economic and Social Council. This shows that human rights have for the first time been juxtaposed with security and development as the \"three main pillars\" of the UN. In recent years, some countries have, according to the UN requirements, set up national human rights organizations such as national human rights commissions, thus putting the promotion and protection of human rights in a more important position. The second is that it has become a common call to have dialogue and oppose confrontation, making those who use human rights to create confrontation be more and more unpopular. All this represents progress and development in the area of international human rights. However, what cannot be ignored is that there are still factors of disharmony in the development of world human rights and there are still stiff challenges. For instance, as the new international political and economic order has not been established and the world economic development is still very uneven, and the South-North gaps continue to grow, the rights to survival and development of the people of developing countries are being seriously threatened. Some countries and regional groups have politicized and ideologized human rights by practicing double standards, flying the \"human rights\" flag to negate the sovereignty of other countries and carry out hegemonism and power politics, thus seriously spoiling the atmosphere of international cooperation in and obstructing the healthy development of human rights in the world. I think that to seek healthy development of human rights in the world, we must, first of all, face up to the prominent problems in the present-day world and rise up to safeguard the rights to survival and development of the people of all countries. At present, armed conflicts and other traditional security problems still exist; non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and environmental pollution have become more and more prominent, seriously threatening the innocent lives of millions of people. The South-North and poor-rich gaps have been further enlarged, with the developed countries with a population of less than 20 percent of the world's total controlling more than 85 percent of the global wealth while developing countries with more than 80 percent of the world's population enjoying less than 15 percent of the wealth of the world. There are more than one billion people in developing countries who are still suffering from poverty, hunger and diseases. Their survival and dignity have been seriously threatened. Only by rooting out the factors that seriously threaten and sabotage human rights, can the rights of the people of all countries be realized. Secondly, it is imperative to integrate the universality of human rights with the national conditions of various countries. All people of all countries should enjoy freedom and equality. This is the universal pursuit and common ideal of mankind. But, restrained by economic development level, cultural traditions and social systems, people have different understandings and demands with regard to human rights and their human rights problems that need priority solution also vary. Under the precondition of recognizing the universality of human rights, all governments and people have the right to adopt different policy measures and ways and means according to their respective national conditions to seek models and paths for human rights development best suited to their national conditions. The diversification of human rights development models not only fully reflects the diversity of civilizations and the wisdom and intelligence of the people of all countries, but also enriches and develops the human rights theories and practice in the world. Respect for the diversity of the human rights development models not only means respect for the national conditions of all countries, the wisdom and creativity of their people, the diversity of civilizations and ways of living, but also constitutes the important precondition for human rights development in the world.</td>\n",

The World Bank, which says 1.2 billion people live on less than dlrs 1 per day, sought advice on relieving poverty through trade, aid and education to help reach the U.N. Millennium Development goals of cutting poverty in half by 2015.</td>\n",

       "      <td>UNDATED: productivity increases.. ``When there is a critical mass of institutions, people and ideas, and they feed on one another and strengthen one another, the competitive revolution begins to set in,'' Drayton said. ``You begin to get a culture that says: `This is great. We're proud to be doing this. We admire people who do this well. We reward them.' It happened in business and it's exactly what you're seeing at the moment in the citizen sector.'' J. Gregory Dees, who teaches social entrepreneurship at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said: ``I'm seeing two broad trends. One is a shift away from the idea of this sector being primarily about charity and the transfer of wealth to being about a desire to find more systemic and sustained solutions to social problems. And the other is an increased openness to experimenting with business methods and market-based approaches.'' These days, donors are more apt to stop financing organizations that cannot demonstrate their effectiveness. Some winning ideas, on the other hand, are rewarded. The Grameen Bank and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a citizen organization, have been so successful in alleviating poverty and educating millions of villagers that they have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of financing from around the globe. More than a thousand development programs worldwide are emulating their experiences. Some activists fear too much competition, arguing that groups can be more effective by forming coalitions. ``We need to find better ways to cooperate with one another if we are going to advocate effectively,'' said Laurie Regelbrugge, the chief operating officer of Civicus, an international network of citizen organizations. Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at the Yale School of Management, points to a different kind of problem: that growth does not necessarily lead to productivity gains unless accompanied by market discipline. ``There are too many nonprofits today and the reason is simply the difficulty in getting them to merge,'' Nalebuff said. ``In the for-profit sector, if an organization is doing poorly, somebody can take it over. There is no such thing as a nonfriendly acquisition in this sector. You need to be in bankruptcy before you lose control, the result being that we have much redundancy.''</td>\n",

       "      <td>Full text: Speech on implementation of National Human Rights\\nAction Plan of China(2009-2010)(2). Over the past year, the Chinese government has adopted a series of major policies and measures, such as expanding domestic demand, restructuring economy, promoting economic growth and improving people's livelihood. The government has taken positive measures to properly cope with the international financial crisis, and has maintained sound yet rapid economic and social growth, thus effectively safeguarded people's rights to subsistence and development as well as their economic, social and cultural rights. Over this year, China has promulgated laws and regulations, including the law on intermediation and arbitration over land contract disputes in rural areas, the Food Safety Law, the regulation on the implementation of the Food Safety Law, and the regulation on fitness for all. China has also made amendments to the Labor Law, the Law on Education, the Law on Agriculture, the Law on Land Contract in Rural Areas, the Flood Control Law, and the Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, guaranteeing citizens' economic, social and cultural rights to greater extent. Meanwhile, the government has taken forceful measures to address issues that have direct bearing on people's well-being, such as employment, health care, social security, increasing farmers' income, education, production safety, prevention against communicable diseases such as A/H1N1 influenza, so that people's rights in various areas have been effectively safeguarded on the basis of steady and fast economic growth. According to statistics, over the first nine months this year, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.7 percent; income of urban and rural residents increased by 10.5 percent and 9.2 percent respectively. About 8.51 million urban residents became employed, 4.02 million laid-off workers reemployed, and 1.2 million people having difficulty in finding jobs employed in the same period. China has been actively promoting the reform of the household registration system, relaxing limits on getting such registrations in small and medium cities. Various channels have been created to get farmers employed in non-farming sectors, and migrant workers' rights and interests have been safeguarded. By the end of September, there had been 152 million migrant workers across the nation, rallying to the level before the global financial crisis. In 2009, 19.73 billion yuan from the central budget were used in poverty reduction, up by 3 billion yuan from last year, and both the growth rate and increment were the highest ever since 1998. A total of  4.13 billion yuan was poured into poverty reduction loan funds. Meanwhile, rural poverty reduction subsidies have been raised to 1,196 yuan per person, covering 40.07 million rural needy people. Poverty reduction measures will apply to all low-income groups in rural areas. Social insurance system has improved, all social insurance compensation being paid in time and in full. The population covered by basic old age insurances, basic health insurances, employment, work injury and children-bearing insurances, and population of migrant workers covered by social insurances have all expanded. By the end of September, the population covered by basic health insurance had reached 362.95 million, 44.74 million more than that of last year. The population covered by new rural cooperative health insurances reached 833 million, 16 million more than that at the end of last year, the coverage ratio staying above 90 percent. In 2009, 61.46 billion yuan of the central budgets went to assistance for urban and rural low-income groups, and 8 billion yuan was used to subsidize urban and rural low- income groups in health care, representing increases of 69.3 percent and 58.7 percent respectively. The central government has made an extra investment of 20 billion yuan in improving the basic medical and health service system, so as to realize equal access among the Chinese to public health services. China has invested more in education, and made greater efforts to develop compulsory education, education in rural areas, and vocational educati on. The central government has spent 57.9 billion yuan on the reform of rural compulsory education funds guarantee mechanism, and exempted all rural students of compulsory education period, covering primary and junior high schools, from tuition and other fees. The government has also spent 5 billion yuan on renovating school buildings in rural junior high schools in central and western China. A financing system to aid students from poor families has been established and improved, and greater efforts have been made to guarantee citizens' rights to education. (more)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chavez's Staying Power. Venezuela just took a democratic step closer to dictatorship. On Sunday, President Hugo Chavez won the right to seek re-election ad infinitum, prevailing in a referendum that eliminated term limits for the presidency and other elected offices. Although the balloting was deemed valid by opposition leaders, who have said they will not contest the results, the victory came about because of Chavez's gross misuse of government funds, government workers and federal facilities for the campaign, and neighborhood enforcers to \"persuade\" voters to support him. He lost a similar vote 14 months ago, but was clearly determined to become president-in-perpetuity and to have Venezuelans vote until they voted his way. Chavez says the people have chosen to make his Bolivarian Revolution permanent. Maybe. But this was not democracy in action. It was the latest accretion of power by a president who essentially controls the Congress, the Supreme Court and the National Electoral Council, which supervises elections. Campaigning relentlessly, Chavez cast the vote as a referendum not just on term limits but on him personally and on voters' commitment to socialist ideology. It was a tussle between those who love the president for his allegiance to the nation's poor -- Chavez warned that his education, health care and business programs for the underprivileged would end with his term in 2013 if he lost -- and those who fear him as a power-seeking autocrat. But these are not contradictory views: Chavez is a dictatorial executive, albeit one who gives ordinary Venezuelans a share in the nation's oil wealth -- even, some economists believe, at the expense of the country's long-term economic health. It is important, however, that the U.S. not allow Venezuela's domestic politics to hinder our diplomatic efforts in the region. The Bush administration's mix of incompetence and swagger -- its emphasis on useless drug eradication and eschewing of poverty reduction -- played into Chavez's hands, allowing him to paint the U.S. as an elitist menace. It is sobering that in supporting Chavez, many Venezuelans also saw themselves as opposing the United States. So, as much as we deplore what looks like the incremental disintegration of democracy in Venezuela, the U.S. must re-engage with Chavez. There are many issues of mutual interest and importance to both countries: trade, immigration, economic development, drug policy and a resolution to the leftist guerrilla conflict across the border in Colombia. Chavez has joked that he plans to stay in office until 2049. And Sunday's vote shows that in crafting its policy for Latin America, the Obama administration will have to take him seriously.</td>\n",

       "      <td>None. Royalty, couturiers, celebrities and development experts have joined hands to put glitz and glamor in fashion from Bangladesh as a way for the country to combat famine and abject poverty. Queen Sophia of Spain and Brazil's First Lady Ruth Cardoso were among nearly 2,000 people who applauded UNESCO's Bangladesh weavers' demonstration and fashion show Wednesday night. A fabric display will continue for a week at the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. ``UNESCO is not planning to get into the fashion business,'' said the organization's general director, Federico Mayor. ``But we want to open the window of Paris on the weavers of Bangladesh.'' The clothes were bright, ethnic and contemporary, and ranged from traditional checked cottons based on what Bangladeshi wear, with tunics and bare-midriff skirts - to silks fit for royalty. Most outfits - for both men and women - were designed by a lissome former model and London fashion student from Bangladesh, Bibi Russell. ``This should be the beginning of cooperative worldwide efforts between creators and artisans to create a world free from poverty,'' she said. The show closed with a rollicking folkoric dance onstage with young Bangladesh student-models and Mayor and others dancing to the compelling rhythms. Actress Marisa Berenson, special ambassador to UNESCO, swung about with the young Bangladeshis, who had just flown in from their country east of India. Queen Sophia told Rosette Mett, owner-designer of the house of Torrente, that she'd soon be wearing one of Torrente's blue and cream safari skirt suits, a product of the Bangladesh weavers shown at UNESCO's parade. Nearly 8,000 weavers are now producing again with backing from Grameen Bank, founded 20 years ago by Muhammad Yunus. Grameen means ``rural'' in Bengali. The weaving cooperative project was founded in 1991. From abject poverty, the poorest of the poor are working their way back to dignity. Looms in Bangladesh are clacking, and the country is producing fabric for fashions, their own native style or haute couture, guided by experts like Russell, who designs and supervises quality control. High fashion is applauding the effort. One fan is Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, a French designer who passionately loves ethnic creativity and natural materials. ``You might call me a Don Quixote,'' he said during the fashion show. ``But I'm interested in couture of the whole world, whether the fabrics come from Fez, Morocco, or Limoges, France, or Dacca, Bangladesh. Fashion is a way to seek spirituality and peace.'' The ecologically-oriented designer also finds this symbiosis of cultures a ``kind of sign language,'' and says he wants to go on working with Bangladeshis, as he has for several years. ``I'd like to promote their fabric with others. These things must be an interchange,'' he said. Yunus _ who studied at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and was a professor at the University of Chittagong _ aims to help the most impoverished of his compatriots by furnishing raw materials, without demanding collateral. He recommended seed money to sponsor cottage industries, usually depending on women, and eventually hit on the idea of reviving the weaving industry. By last year, Grameen Bank had 1,052 branches. It had disbursed loans of over dlrs 1.5 billion, had savings in a group fund of dlrs 107 million and financed the building of 326,754 houses with loans. For textile weaving Yunus got help from Russel, who studied fashion in England, married an Englishman and became a model but finally returned to Bangladesh with a mission to help her people revive artisan and creative pursuits. She started designing fabric patterns, then clothes, to promote Bangladeshi fabrics. ``I want to show the beautiful things we have,'' said Bibi Russell after the fashion show. She uses only natural substances for her styles, including jewelry and accessories of wood, straw and shells. At the weaving demonstration, two Bangladeshis on their first trip abroad clacked away at their looms. Their beautiful luminous plaids in soft cotton fabrics were displayed around the hall. ``We're aiming for a 1996 target of 10 million metres (yards) of our high-quality fabrics, and will be putting 15,000 weavers to work,'' said Yunus. slot v0153/tw</td>\n",

Republican lawmakers, resisting a White House request to lift the minimum wage for US employees, on Wednesday unveiled their own plan to help the working poor. The issue has emerged as a hot political topic in this presidential election year, with the Democratic White House and its allies in Congress pushing for a 90-cent increase in the 4.25 dollar minimum wage. Feeling the pressure, Republican leaders proposed their own plan -- but it would not raise the minimum wage. Instead, they would restructure a current program that gives income tax rebates to poor families earning the minimum wage. Under the proposal single workers earning the wage -- which, at 8,840 dollars per year is just above the poverty level for one person -- would receive no tax rebates while poor families would see the amounts they currently receive go up. Representative Dick Armey, majority leader of the Republican- controlled House of Representatives, said the plan would \"improve the well-being of low income workers without destroying job opportunities.\"   \n",
       "XIN_ENG_20081209.0269  Full Text: Wang Chen: China Registers Historic Progress in Human\\nRights (5). Q. Great changes have taken place in the present-day international human rights. How do you view the present situation in this field? How do you think the world human rights cause can develop healthily? A. There are two prominent features in the current international human rights situation. One is that the international community has never attached such great importance to human rights as at present and human rights have become an important subject in international exchange and cooperation. Since the end of the Cold War, human rights issues have become increasingly important in international relations and international politics. With the rapid growth of economic globalization and informationization of social life, countries have become increasingly inter-dependent and mutually cooperative, thus accentuating the importance of human rights issues. Countries have attached more and more importance to human rights issues and reached more and more common understanding on these issues. In March 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, deciding to set up the Human Rights Council under it to replace the Human Rights Commission affiliated to the UN Economic and Social Council. This shows that human rights have for the first time been juxtaposed with security and development as the \"three main pillars\" of the UN. In recent years, some countries have, according to the UN requirements, set up national human rights organizations such as national human rights commissions, thus putting the promotion and protection of human rights in a more important position. The second is that it has become a common call to have dialogue and oppose confrontation, making those who use human rights to create confrontation be more and more unpopular. All this represents progress and development in the area of international human rights. However, what cannot be ignored is that there are still factors of disharmony in the development of world human rights and there are still stiff challenges. For instance, as the new international political and economic order has not been established and the world economic development is still very uneven, and the South-North gaps continue to grow, the rights to survival and development of the people of developing countries are being seriously threatened. Some countries and regional groups have politicized and ideologized human rights by practicing double standards, flying the \"human rights\" flag to negate the sovereignty of other countries and carry out hegemonism and power politics, thus seriously spoiling the atmosphere of international cooperation in and obstructing the healthy development of human rights in the world. I think that to seek healthy development of human rights in the world, we must, first of all, face up to the prominent problems in the present-day world and rise up to safeguard the rights to survival and development of the people of all countries. At present, armed conflicts and other traditional security problems still exist; non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and environmental pollution have become more and more prominent, seriously threatening the innocent lives of millions of people. The South-North and poor-rich gaps have been further enlarged, with the developed countries with a population of less than 20 percent of the world's total controlling more than 85 percent of the global wealth while developing countries with more than 80 percent of the world's population enjoying less than 15 percent of the wealth of the world. There are more than one billion people in developing countries who are still suffering from poverty, hunger and diseases. Their survival and dignity have been seriously threatened. Only by rooting out the factors that seriously threaten and sabotage human rights, can the rights of the people of all countries be realized. Secondly, it is imperative to integrate the universality of human rights with the national conditions of various countries. All people of all countries should enjoy freedom and equality. This is the universal pursuit and common ideal of mankind. But, restrained by economic development level, cultural traditions and social systems, people have different understandings and demands with regard to human rights and their human rights problems that need priority solution also vary. Under the precondition of recognizing the universality of human rights, all governments and people have the right to adopt different policy measures and ways and means according to their respective national conditions to seek models and paths for human rights development best suited to their national conditions. The diversification of human rights development models not only fully reflects the diversity of civilizations and the wisdom and intelligence of the people of all countries, but also enriches and develops the human rights theories and practice in the world. Respect for the diversity of the human rights development models not only means respect for the national conditions of all countries, the wisdom and creativity of their people, the diversity of civilizations and ways of living, but also constitutes the important precondition for human rights development in the world.   \n",

A World Bank conference closed Wednesday with words of hope for the poor and warnings of the threats of uncontrolled globalization and development. About 300 academics and World Bank officials from more than 70 countries spent three days at the Holmenkollen Park Hotel discussing how to alleviate global poverty. Norwegian Minister of Development Aid Hilde Frafjord Johnson, as host, closed the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics-Europe, or ABCDE, with a message of encouragement. ``I hope you have inspired the World Bank to take one step further toward pro-poor policies,'' she said. ``Let us leave this conference with a commitment to ensure that five years from now there are fewer voices of the poor.''

A World Bank conference closed Wednesday with words of hope for the poor and warnings of the threats of uncontrolled globalization and development. About 300 academics and World Bank officials from more than 70 countries spent three days at the scenic Holmenkollen Park Hotel overlooking Oslo discussing how to alleviate global poverty. Norwegian Minister of Development Aid Hilde Frafjord Johnson, as host, closed the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics-Europe, or ABCDE, with a message of encouragement. ``I hope you have inspired the World Bank to take one step further toward pro-poor policies,'' she said. ``Let us leave this conference with a commitment to ensure that five years from now there are fewer voices of the poor.'' The World Bank, which says 1.2 billion people live on less than dlrs 1 per day, sought advice on relieving poverty through trade, aid and education to help reach the U.N.

We're proud to be doing this. We admire people who do this well. We reward them.' It happened in business and it's exactly what you're seeing at the moment in the citizen sector.'' J. Gregory Dees, who teaches social entrepreneurship at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said: ``I'm seeing two broad trends. One is a shift away from the idea of this sector being primarily about charity and the transfer of wealth to being about a desire to find more systemic and sustained solutions to social problems. And the other is an increased openness to experimenting with business methods and market-based approaches.'' These days, donors are more apt to stop financing organizations that cannot demonstrate their effectiveness. Some winning ideas, on the other hand, are rewarded. The Grameen Bank and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a citizen organization, have been so successful in alleviating poverty and educating millions of villagers that they have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of financing from around the globe. More than a thousand development programs worldwide are emulating their experiences. Some activists fear too much competition, arguing that groups can be more effective by forming coalitions. ``We need to find better ways to cooperate with one another if we are going to advocate effectively,'' said Laurie Regelbrugge, the chief operating officer of Civicus, an international network of citizen organizations. Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at the Yale School of Management, points to a different kind of problem: that growth does not necessarily lead to productivity gains unless accompanied by market discipline. ``There are too many nonprofits today and the reason is simply the difficulty in getting them to merge,'' Nalebuff said. ``In the for-profit sector, if an organization is doing poorly, somebody can take it over. There is no such thing as a nonfriendly acquisition in this sector. You need to be in bankruptcy before you lose control, the result being that we have much redundancy.''   \n",

Over the past year, the Chinese government has adopted a series of major policies and measures, such as expanding domestic demand, restructuring economy, promoting economic growth and improving people's livelihood. The government has taken positive measures to properly cope with the international financial crisis, and has maintained sound yet rapid economic and social growth, thus effectively safeguarded people's rights to subsistence and development as well as their economic, social and cultural rights. Over this year, China has promulgated laws and regulations, including the law on intermediation and arbitration over land contract disputes in rural areas, the Food Safety Law, the regulation on the implementation of the Food Safety Law, and the regulation on fitness for all. China has also made amendments to the Labor Law, the Law on Education, the Law on Agriculture, the Law on Land Contract in Rural Areas, the Flood Control Law, and the Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, guaranteeing citizens' economic, social and cultural rights to greater extent. Meanwhile, the government has taken forceful measures to address issues that have direct bearing on people's well-being, such as employment, health care, social security, increasing farmers' income, education, production safety, prevention against communicable diseases such as A/H1N1 influenza, so that people's rights in various areas have been effectively safeguarded on the basis of steady and fast economic growth. According to statistics, over the first nine months this year, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.7 percent; income of urban and rural residents increased by 10.5 percent and 9.2 percent respectively. About 8.51 million urban residents became employed, 4.02 million laid-off workers reemployed, and 1.2 million people having difficulty in finding jobs employed in the same period. China has been actively promoting the reform of the household registration system, relaxing limits on getting such registrations in small and medium cities. Various channels have been created to get farmers employed in non-farming sectors, and migrant workers' rights and interests have been safeguarded. By the end of September, there had been 152 million migrant workers across the nation, rallying to the level before the global financial crisis. In 2009, 19.73 billion yuan from the central budget were used in poverty reduction, up by 3 billion yuan from last year, and both the growth rate and increment were the highest ever since 1998. A total of  4.13 billion yuan was poured into poverty reduction loan funds. Meanwhile, rural poverty reduction subsidies have been raised to 1,196 yuan per person, covering 40.07 million rural needy people. Poverty reduction measures will apply to all low-income groups in rural areas. Social insurance system has improved, all social insurance compensation being paid in time and in full. The population covered by basic old age insurances, basic health insurances, employment, work injury and children-bearing insurances, and population of migrant workers covered by social insurances have all expanded. By the end of September, the population covered by basic health insurance had reached 362.95 million, 44.74 million more than that of last year. The population covered by new rural cooperative health insurances reached 833 million, 16 million more than that at the end of last year, the coverage ratio staying above 90 percent. In 2009, 61.46 billion yuan of the central budgets went to assistance for urban and rural low-income groups, and 8 billion yuan was used to subsidize urban and rural low- income groups in health care, representing increases of 69.3 percent and 58.7 percent respectively. The central government has made an extra investment of 20 billion yuan in improving the basic medical and health service system, so as to realize equal access among the Chinese to public health services. China has invested more in education, and made greater efforts to develop compulsory education, education in rural areas, and vocational educati on. The central government has spent 57.9 billion yuan on the reform of rural compulsory education funds guarantee mechanism, and exempted all rural students of compulsory education period, covering primary and junior high schools, from tuition and other fees. The government has also spent 5 billion yuan on renovating school buildings in rural junior high schools in central and western China. A financing system to aid students from poor families has been established and improved, and greater efforts have been made to guarantee citizens' rights to education. (more)   \n",

Venezuela just took a democratic step closer to dictatorship. On Sunday, President Hugo Chavez won the right to seek re-election ad infinitum, prevailing in a referendum that eliminated term limits for the presidency and other elected offices. Although the balloting was deemed valid by opposition leaders, who have said they will not contest the results, the victory came about because of Chavez's gross misuse of government funds, government workers and federal facilities for the campaign, and neighborhood enforcers to \"persuade\" voters to support him. He lost a similar vote 14 months ago, but was clearly determined to become president-in-perpetuity and to have Venezuelans vote until they voted his way. Chavez says the people have chosen to make his Bolivarian Revolution permanent. Maybe. But this was not democracy in action. It was the latest accretion of power by a president who essentially controls the Congress, the Supreme Court and the National Electoral Council, which supervises elections. Campaigning relentlessly, Chavez cast the vote as a referendum not just on term limits but on him personally and on voters' commitment to socialist ideology. It was a tussle between those who love the president for his allegiance to the nation's poor -- Chavez warned that his education, health care and business programs for the underprivileged would end with his term in 2013 if he lost -- and those who fear him as a power-seeking autocrat. But these are not contradictory views: Chavez is a dictatorial executive, albeit one who gives ordinary Venezuelans a share in the nation's oil wealth -- even, some economists believe, at the expense of the country's long-term economic health. It is important, however, that the U.S. not allow Venezuela's domestic politics to hinder our diplomatic efforts in the region. The Bush administration's mix of incompetence and swagger -- its emphasis on useless drug eradication and eschewing of poverty reduction -- played into Chavez's hands, allowing him to paint the U.S. as an elitist menace. It is sobering that in supporting Chavez, many Venezuelans also saw themselves as opposing the United States. So, as much as we deplore what looks like the incremental disintegration of democracy in Venezuela, the U.S. must re-engage with Chavez. There are many issues of mutual interest and importance to both countries: trade, immigration, economic development, drug policy and a resolution to the leftist guerrilla conflict across the border in Colombia. Chavez has joked that he plans to stay in office until 2049. And Sunday's vote shows that in crafting its policy for Latin America, the Obama administration will have to take him seriously.   \n",

Royalty, couturiers, celebrities and development experts have joined hands to put glitz and glamor in fashion from Bangladesh as a way for the country to combat famine and abject poverty. Queen Sophia of Spain and Brazil's First Lady Ruth Cardoso were among nearly 2,000 people who applauded UNESCO's Bangladesh weavers' demonstration and fashion show Wednesday night. A fabric display will continue for a week at the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. ``UNESCO is not planning to get into the fashion business,'' said the organization's general director, Federico Mayor. ``But we want to open the window of Paris on the weavers of Bangladesh.'' The clothes were bright, ethnic and contemporary, and ranged from traditional checked cottons based on what Bangladeshi wear, with tunics and bare-midriff skirts - to silks fit for royalty. Most outfits - for both men and women - were designed by a lissome former model and London fashion student from Bangladesh, Bibi Russell. ``This should be the beginning of cooperative worldwide efforts between creators and artisans to create a world free from poverty,'' she said. The show closed with a rollicking folkoric dance onstage with young Bangladesh student-models and Mayor and others dancing to the compelling rhythms. Actress Marisa Berenson, special ambassador to UNESCO, swung about with the young Bangladeshis, who had just flown in from their country east of India. Queen Sophia told Rosette Mett, owner-designer of the house of Torrente, that she'd soon be wearing one of Torrente's blue and cream safari skirt suits, a product of the Bangladesh weavers shown at UNESCO's parade. Nearly 8,000 weavers are now producing again with backing from Grameen Bank, founded 20 years ago by Muhammad Yunus. Grameen means ``rural'' in Bengali. The weaving cooperative project was founded in 1991. From abject poverty, the poorest of the poor are working their way back to dignity. Looms in Bangladesh are clacking, and the country is producing fabric for fashions, their own native style or haute couture, guided by experts like Russell, who designs and supervises quality control. High fashion is applauding the effort. One fan is Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, a French designer who passionately loves ethnic creativity and natural materials. ``You might call me a Don Quixote,'' he said during the fashion show. ``But I'm interested in couture of the whole world, whether the fabrics come from Fez, Morocco, or Limoges, France, or Dacca, Bangladesh. Fashion is a way to seek spirituality and peace.'' The ecologically-oriented designer also finds this symbiosis of cultures a ``kind of sign language,'' and says he wants to go on working with Bangladeshis, as he has for several years. ``I'd like to promote their fabric with others. These things must be an interchange,'' he said. Yunus _ who studied at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and was a professor at the University of Chittagong _ aims to help the most impoverished of his compatriots by furnishing raw materials, without demanding collateral. He recommended seed money to sponsor cottage industries, usually depending on women, and eventually hit on the idea of reviving the weaving industry. By last year, Grameen Bank had 1,052 branches. It had disbursed loans of over dlrs 1.5 billion, had savings in a group fund of dlrs 107 million and financed the building of 326,754 houses with loans. For textile weaving Yunus got help from Russel, who studied fashion in England, married an Englishman and became a model but finally returned to Bangladesh with a mission to help her people revive artisan and creative pursuits. She started designing fabric patterns, then clothes, to promote Bangladeshi fabrics. ``I want to show the beautiful things we have,'' said Bibi Russell after the fashion show. She uses only natural substances for her styles, including jewelry and accessories of wood, straw and shells. At the weaving demonstration, two Bangladeshis on their first trip abroad clacked away at their looms.
