A human rights organization criticized the Brazilian government's program to eliminate hunger, saying Wednesday the plan has delivered little in the way of real change. Speaking in Geneva before presenting the Germany-based group's findings to the United Nations, FIAN International said the South American country's government was as far away as ever from providing a lasting solution for the more than 50 million Brazilians living under the poverty line. Eradicating hunger was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's main election promise when he swept into office two years ago. But his government now \"has very little time to prove that its Zero Hunger program does not turn into a zero solution to hunger,\" said Clovis Zimmermann, who headed the study. The aim of the much-heralded Zero Hunger program was to ensure that all Brazilians had enough to eat by redistributing land and providing monthly relief to the country's poorest families. \"If at the end of my mandate all Brazilians have the possibility to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, I will have fulfilled the mission of my life,\" Silva said at his inauguration in January 2003.</td>\n",

Preston said in a foreword to the report: \"The World Bank's Strategy for Reducing Poverty and Hunger.\" Contrary to popular perception, not all hunger is caused by droughts, famines, and wars, the report said. The more subtle form of hunger, that is chronic, widespread and deep-rooted, is \"silent hunger\" caused by people lacking the capacity to produce food or the income to buy it. \"People-centered policies work best in combating hunger and poverty,\" said Ismail Serageldin, the Bank's vice-president, under whose direction the report was accomplished. \"Ample evidence exists to show that broad-based, sustainable economic growth coupled with improved access to education, health care and social services reduces poverty and goes a long way to fighting hunger,\" added Serageldin.</td>\n",

The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 11: The idea of compelling employers doing city business to pay workers a living wage _ sufficiently above the minimum wage to break the poverty line _ has taken hold in about 80 cities and communities around the nation. Now, New York has come up with its own modest version, which should be a first step toward helping some of the city's poorest workers. This is not a good time to be spending city money. But this is a worthy cause and we're glad the City Council has produced a prudent bill that should not cost the city more than $1 million the first year. The council's plan, passed last week with bipartisan support and sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, would raise the pay of 50,000 home health care attendants _ most of them black, Hispanic and immigrant women _ who help care for sick, elderly and disabled patients through home care agencies that contract with the city through Medicaid. Their pay would increase to $8.10 an hour with benefits (about 60 cents above the current average), or $9.60 an hour without benefits, rising to a minimum of $10 an hour by mid-2006. It's no coincidence that these workers are members of the powerful SEIU Local 1199, headed by Dennis Rivera, which led a coalition pressing for the bill. The measure reflects union muscle _ the American Federation of Teachers also won living-wage coverage for some of its child care workers. It's also politically pragmatic, seeking to cover workers in a way that is less likely to draw a mayoral veto. Bloomberg balked at any bill that would affect private firms that might move elsewhere, such as employers in commercial properties leased to the city or companies that receive city subsidies.</td>\n",

The senior minister noted that the five-year plan will focus on the following priorities: long-term sustainable economic development at annual rate of 6 to 7 percent; effective and sustainable exploitation and management of natural and environment resources. To achieve the goal, firstly, the Royal government in the next five years would create a preferable environment for investment attraction by maintaining peace, stability, social order, human rights protection and democracy, as well as developing a general framework with transparency, accountability and predictability, Sok An said. Secondly, the government must make efforts to mobilize investment resources on priority areas, such as agriculture, tourism, human resource development, and bringing the role of women into play in development of agriculture and rural community, he added.

In line with the strategic goal of the nation's modernization drive and proceeding from national conditions, the Chinese Government has formulated and implemented a population policy which conforms to China's reality and has greatly contributed to the stabilization of the national and the world population and to the promotion of human development and progress. The Chinese Government is willing to continue its efforts together with the international community to effectively solve the problem of population and development. The Chinese Government firmly believes that China's population and development cause will develop further in the 21st century and that China will make still greater contribution to the civilization and progress of mankind! . Current Situation and Prospect 5. Since the 1970s, especially since the initiation of the reform and opening-up drive, China has formulated a basic state policy to promote family planning in an all-round way so as to slow down population growth and improve population quality in terms of health and education. The Government encourages late marriage and late childbearing, and advocates the practice of \"one couple, one child\" and of \"having a second child with proper spacing in accordance with the laws and regulations\". Family planning is also advocated among the ethnic minorities. Various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government have formulated their own policies and regulations according to local conditions. 6. The Chinese Government pays great attention to the issue of population and development and has placed it on the agenda as an important part in the overall plan of China's national economic and social development. The Government consistently emphasizes that population growth should be compatible with socio-economic development and be in concert with resource utilization and environmental protection. Since the 1990s, the Central Government has convened a National Summit Meeting on the issue of population and development once a year for the sake of adopting important decisions and measures based upon discussion and analysis of the major problems. The Government organizes and coordinates the relevant departments and mass organizations to implement the population and family planning program, striving to integrate the family planning program with economic development, poverty eradication, protection of ecological environment, rational resource utilization, universal education, advancement of public health and social security, and improvement of women's status. This is aimed at seeking a thorough solution to the problem of population and development.</td>\n",

Overall Requirements and Major Objectives for Economic and Social Development in 2008 In pursuing economic and social development in 2008, we must fully implement the guidelines adopted at the Seventeenth Party Congress, hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide and thoroughly apply the Scientific Outlook on Development. We will focus our efforts on transforming the pattern of economic development and improving the socialist market economy. We will continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation, work vigorously to advance reform and opening up and strengthen the country's capacity for independent innovation, and work hard to improve the economic structure and quality of economic growth. We must intensify efforts to save energy, reduce emissions and protect the environment. More attention will be paid to enhancing people's wellbeing and promoting social harmony as we strive for sound and fast economic development. In view of the above requirements and what is needed versus what is possible, and in conformity with the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, we have set the following major objectives for economic and social development in 2008: - Raising the quality of economic growth. We need to further improve the economic structure, accelerate the development of tertiary industry, increase the contribution of high-tech industries to the economy and increase R&amp;D expenditures as a percentage of GDP to 1.6%. Energy consumption per unit of GDP, sulfur dioxide emissions and chemical oxygen demand should fall by a larger margin than last year. Government revenue and corporate profits are expected to grow steadily. On the basis of structural improvement, improved efficiency, lower energy consumption and environmental protection measures, China's GDP is expected to grow by about 8% in 2008. A major reason for introducing the above targets for economic development is to communicate to society the government's regulatory intentions and guide all sectors to focus their work and attention on transforming the pattern of development, improving the quality of economic growth, saving energy and reducing emissions in order to achieve both sound and fast development. All local authorities should set targets for local GDP growth at an appropriate level in line with local conditions and avoid blind competition and setting targets at each administrative level that are too high. - Continuing to improve people's lives. Urban employment should expand by 10 million new jobs and the urban registered unemployment rate should stay at about 4.5%. The incomes of urban and rural residents should continue to increase fairly fast. Per capita net income of rural residents should increase by 6% or more in real terms. The new system of rural cooperative medical care should cover all rural areas and will receive more subsidies from the central and local government budgets. The number of rural people living in poverty should be reduced by 2 million or more. Fiscal guarantees to ensure adequate funding for compulsory education in rural areas will be strengthened. The program of free education for urban students taking compulsory education will be fully instituted. Natural population growth should stay within 0.7%. The major factors taken into consideration in setting the above goals are: national economic growth has been steady and fast for several years in a row, the financial strength of the country has further increased, the performance of enterprises has markedly improved and the impact of the vigorous employment policy is becoming increasingly noticeable. In addition, the implementation of policy measures to promote increase in people's incomes, especially that of farmers, and strengthen the social safety net has made it necessary and created the conditions for us to further expand employment, increase the incomes of urban and rural residents and address issues affecting people's wellbeing such as education and medical care.

Poverty has always been a prime concern of all peoples, in particular the people of developing countries. However, the absolute number of the global poor population has not reduced, but rather is increasing. Until the basic rights to subsistence and development are met, the poor will remain unable to truly enjoy economic, social and cultural rights. The existence of huge numbers of poor people should cause all countries to be aware that global social development is only beginning. The Chinese government acknowledges that international cooperation for social development should be further strengthened. The international community should attach greater importance to the issues facing developing countries, and provide more assistance in the form of funds and technology.

Venezuela has claimed about 600,000 hectares (about 1.5 million acres) of farmlands as state property to be turned over to poor farmers, giving hope to some while raising concern among others about the future of private property in the country. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel defended the agrarian reform program Thursday, saying Venezuela \"is broadening the system of private property\" by making lands available to poor farmers. \"That is social justice,\" he said. The government's National Lands Institute so far has declared 21 ranches to be state property, saying they were determined to be \"idle\" and those who claimed ownership couldn't prove it through documents. The government has helped poor farmers form cooperatives to start to work the land, despite legal challenges from those who used to run the ranches. President Hugo Chavez, who on Thursday took his anti-poverty message to the United Nations, said earlier this week that \"private property has to be subordinate to the general interest.\" However, he has insisted private property rights will be upheld, as outlined in Venezuela's constitution.</td>\n",

The government announced Monday that it would set minimum wages for farm laborers as from next year, saying the measure was necessary to protect one of the country's most exploited groups of workers. On average, farm laborers earned 544 rand ($58) a month last year, but some took home as little as 200 rand ($22). As from March next year farm laborers would have to be paid at least 800 rand ($86) a month in wealthy areas, and 650 rand ($70) in poorer regions, Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said. These amounts could be reduced slightly by farmers who gave their workers food and accommodation. Mdladlana said the fact that many farm workers were poverty stricken clearly illustrated the need for a minimum wage, but the government recognized that if the level was set too high jobs would be lost.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Full text of President Jiang's address to second GEF Assembly (3). On this, I would like to make a few observations. First, since there is only one earth for us to share, ensuring its sustainable development is the common responsibility of all countries. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities for the developed and developing countries must be upheld. When apportioning the responsibilities for sustainable development, it is necessary to take full account of the uneven development of all countries, and abide by the principles of fairness, impartiality and rationality. The developed countries should take the lead in changing the ways of production and consumption that are inconsistent with sustainable development, take a more active part in addressing the global environmental issues and help the developing countries with concrete deeds. Meanwhile, the developing countries should also work hard and promote their development in their own countries along the requirement of sustainable development. Second, the global actions of sustainable development should give full respect for the sovereignty of countries and their independence in choosing their own path of development. The ability of each country to independently choose its own social system and development model in light of its national conditions and to retain control of its development process is the vital guarantee to effective protection of the country's environment and realization of its sustainable development. All countries should take positive steps, in keeping with their actual conditions, to rationally exploit and utilize natural resources, protect the ecosystem and promote a harmonious development of economic growth and environmental protection. While promoting economic development on their own soil, countries should also be watchful against possible harm done to the environment of other countries. Third, the environment issue bears on the common interests of mankind. International environmental norms should be formulated through the equal participation of all countries and reflect their wills and interests. In doing so, the difficulties of the developing countries should be taken into full consideration and their actual needs respected in an effort to establish a sincere partnership with them. Fourth, since the developing countries are faced with dual tasks of poverty eradication and environmental protection, it will be very hard for them to achieve sustainable development without a sound and supportive international economic environment. To them, a deteriorating environment is the result of poverty. Continuous efforts should therefore be made to combine poverty elimination with environmental protection. While giving continued attention to the global issues bearing on mankind's survival and development, it is necessary to help the developing countries with their own problems that have a restraining effect on their development. Reforms should be introduced to the international finance, investment and trade regimes. More transfers of funds and technology should be made to the developing countries to ensure their rights to equal development in the age of economic globalization and promote capacity building in these countries.

A human rights advocate concerned with sweatshop labor says some athletic apparel is made under dismal working conditions, and he is calling on professional athletes to help stop the practice. At a protest in Manhattan on Friday, Charles Kernaghan, the executive director of the New York-based National Labor Committee, spoke specifically about a factory in rural Honduras where he said the athletic apparel company Reebok makes some replica jerseys for the NBA and NFL. Among those he used as examples were the jerseys of Nets guard Jason Kidd and Giants quarterback Eli Manning. Reebok is the exclusive provider of official jerseys for the two leagues, and the company also makes replica jerseys. \"Women are locked in that factory compound 10 to 13 hours a day,\" Kernaghan said from the sidewalk in front of the NBA Store at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. \"They're paid 19 cents for every $75 jersey they sold. Their wages come to just three-tenths of 1 percent of the retail price, trapping them in misery. Overtime is obligatory; workers need permission to use the bathrooms; supervisors are abusive, yelling and cursing at the workers to go faster.\" If the 1,500 or so workers at the factory attempt to unionize, he added, they will be fired and blacklisted. The workers, mostly women in their 20s, are paid up to 82 cents an hour, Kernaghan said. A raise, he added, to $1.21 an hour would at least allow the workers to go from \"misery to poverty.\"</td>\n",

By spending more aid money on getting poor countries ready for disasters, rich nations could save thousands of lives, face smaller bills after floods or hurricanes, and boost the fight against poverty, the international Red Cross said Wednesday. The World Disasters Report, issued annually by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the economic and social cost of such events could be slashed if donors used their money more wisely _ before, rather than just after high profile disasters. ``Disasters aren't just little blips on the development curve,'' said Red Cross official Peter Walker, who edited the 239-page study. ``If we don't take them into account then we haven't got a chance'' of lifting poor countries out of poverty. Walker said donors should think like investors and target a larger proportion of their foreign aid to disaster preparedness. He did not suggest figures, but said the sums involved would be less than the current dlrs 6.3 billion a year it costs to rebuild after a catastrophe.

Everything about her life changes for the better and it's the most important, significant, humanitarian, political, or economic investment the world can make in its future,\" he said. Morris, an American businessman and former foundation president, is stepping down as the Rome-based World Food Program's executive director in April after five years in the forefront of helping victims of conflicts, natural disasters and poverty. WFP is the world's largest humanitarian organization, reaching close to 100 million people in more than 80 countries every year with life-sustaining food and other assistance.</td>\n",

Last year's Asian tsunami hit poor people far harder than the middle class and wealthy, and the aid effort could worsen the income gap in affected regions, a major aid group said Saturday. Nearly six months after the enormous Dec. 26 disaster, Oxfam said those aiding the survivors must work hard to reach out to the poor and help them build better lives than they had before. Just replacing the destroyed assets of landowners and businesspeople would leave behind those who owned little, and exacerbate the divide between rich and poor, the agency said. \"Desperately poor people have been made poorer still by the tsunami,\" said Oxfam's Britain director, Barbara Stocking. \"The generous response of the public has put us in a strong position to address these problems. We must use this as an opportunity to help people work their way out of poverty and to ensure they are better placed to deal with natural disasters if and when they strike again,\" she said.</td>\n",

Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday announced an increase in the minimum wage paid to workers in Britain, a move seen as an attempt to increase support for the governing Labour Party before elections expected in May. The government announced that the minimum wage would rise from 4.85 pounds (US$9.26, euro7) to 5.05 pounds (US$9.64, euro7.3) in October for workers aged 22 and above. The level for workers aged 18-21 will rise from 4.10 pounds (US$7.82, euro5.93) to 4.25 pounds (US$8.11, euro6.16) in October. Speaking at his monthly news conference, Blair said the minimum wage was a \"a powerful symbol of how this country is changing for the good.\" The increase is likely to delight trade unionists, an important force within the Labour Party. Some business leaders are concerned, however, that such an increase is unsustainable. Blair has argued that low wages create a poverty trap, encouraging people to draw unemployment benefits rather than finding work. The issue is likely to figure prominently in national elections, with Labour reminding voters that the main opposition Conservative Party rejected the minimum wage in the 1997 election campaign.</td>\n",

The report said Bangladesh still has the third highest number of hungry people in the world, after India and China. And around 39 percent of the South Asian country's under 5 years old children are underweight and 27 percent of the total population suffers from malnutrition. The report said the number of food insecure citizens reduced from 40 million to 27 million over the last decade in Bangladesh. But, largely due to high food prices in 2007 and 2008, the number of Bangladeshi people facing food insecurity has risen with the cyclone Aila further adding to the pressure. The country has improved nutrition level among children below 5 years in the last two decades, but still has a long way to go to combat malnutrition, the report said.</td>\n",

A human rights organization criticized the Brazilian government's program to eliminate hunger, saying Wednesday the plan has delivered little in the way of real change. Speaking in Geneva before presenting the Germany-based group's findings to the United Nations, FIAN International said the South American country's government was as far away as ever from providing a lasting solution for the more than 50 million Brazilians living under the poverty line. Eradicating hunger was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's main election promise when he swept into office two years ago. But his government now \"has very little time to prove that its Zero Hunger program does not turn into a zero solution to hunger,\" said Clovis Zimmermann, who headed the study. The aim of the much-heralded Zero Hunger program was to ensure that all Brazilians had enough to eat by redistributing land and providing monthly relief to the country's poorest families. \"If at the end of my mandate all Brazilians have the possibility to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, I will have fulfilled the mission of my life,\" Silva said at his inauguration in January 2003.   \n",

In a country where a third of the population lives in poverty, the 1999-2000 union budget presented Saturday unveiled modest measures to improve health, education and employment for the poor. ``This is an excellent, balanced budget, a pro-poor and pro-farmer budget. It will generate employment, reduce disparities and help the poor in meeting his or her daily requirements,'' said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha proposed a program to create jobs by encouraging small-scale industry in 100 rural areas. Sinha said 1.8 million more schools would dot the countryside, where most Indians live, guaranteeing free education to poor children. The government would pay for the schools from existing education funds but would also encourage local communities to contribute in the effort. Local councils were also encouraged to collect funds from villagers to supplement federal funds for clinics.   \n",

The World Bank said that some 750 million people go hungry every day in today's world. The persistence of hunger in the world has posed one of the most daunting development challenges facing the global community today, the World Bank said in a strategy statement Wednesday. \"If we want to reduce hunger effectively, we have to reduce poverty,\" the Bank's President Lewis T. Preston said in a foreword to the report: \"The World Bank's Strategy for Reducing Poverty and Hunger.\" Contrary to popular perception, not all hunger is caused by droughts, famines, and wars, the report said. The more subtle form of hunger, that is chronic, widespread and deep-rooted, is \"silent hunger\" caused by people lacking the capacity to produce food or the income to buy it. \"People-centered policies work best in combating hunger and poverty,\" said Ismail Serageldin, the Bank's vice-president, under whose direction the report was accomplished. \"Ample evidence exists to show that broad-based, sustainable economic growth coupled with improved access to education, health care and social services reduces poverty and goes a long way to fighting hunger,\" added Serageldin.   \n",

The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 11: The idea of compelling employers doing city business to pay workers a living wage _ sufficiently above the minimum wage to break the poverty line _ has taken hold in about 80 cities and communities around the nation. Now, New York has come up with its own modest version, which should be a first step toward helping some of the city's poorest workers. This is not a good time to be spending city money. But this is a worthy cause and we're glad the City Council has produced a prudent bill that should not cost the city more than $1 million the first year. The council's plan, passed last week with bipartisan support and sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, would raise the pay of 50,000 home health care attendants _ most of them black, Hispanic and immigrant women _ who help care for sick, elderly and disabled patients through home care agencies that contract with the city through Medicaid. Their pay would increase to $8.10 an hour with benefits (about 60 cents above the current average), or $9.60 an hour without benefits, rising to a minimum of $10 an hour by mid-2006. It's no coincidence that these workers are members of the powerful SEIU Local 1199, headed by Dennis Rivera, which led a coalition pressing for the bill. The measure reflects union muscle _ the American Federation of Teachers also won living-wage coverage for some of its child care workers. It's also politically pragmatic, seeking to cover workers in a way that is less likely to draw a mayoral veto. Bloomberg balked at any bill that would affect private firms that might move elsewhere, such as employers in commercial properties leased to the city or companies that receive city subsidies.   \n",

The provincial trade union of Liaoning, a heavy industry base in northeast China, has pledged to be the first source of aid for poverty-haunted workers. Liaoning will set up a network for these workers to ensure they receive all the benefits and social security they are entitled to. Trade unions at all level must guarantee that no poor workers or their families suffer, said Zhang Zhenxi, vice-chairman of the provincial trade union. Zhang said trade unions should spare no efforts to care for poor workers and provide their families with money, clothing, and food. He said that officials will aid 5,000 additional poor households this year in order to help them eventually escape poverty.   \n",

Addressing the workshop, organized by the Ministry of Planning and the Asian Development Bank, Sok An, senior minister and cabinet minister, said the SEDPII must serve as an important guide to reduce poverty and improve living standard of millions of the people, particularly those who live in rural areas and often affected with natural disaster. The senior minister noted that the five-year plan will focus on the following priorities: long-term sustainable economic development at annual rate of 6 to 7 percent; effective and sustainable exploitation and management of natural and environment resources. To achieve the goal, firstly, the Royal government in the next five years would create a preferable environment for investment attraction by maintaining peace, stability, social order, human rights protection and democracy, as well as developing a general framework with transparency, accountability and predictability, Sok An said. Secondly, the government must make efforts to mobilize investment resources on priority areas, such as agriculture, tourism, human resource development, and bringing the role of women into play in development of agriculture and rural community, he added. Thirdly, institution building and good governance are the key foundation in the concept of sustainable development and social justice in order to strengthen rules of law, deepen public administrative reform, combat against corruption, the minister pointed out.   \n",

In line with the strategic goal of the nation's modernization drive and proceeding from national conditions, the Chinese Government has formulated and implemented a population policy which conforms to China's reality and has greatly contributed to the stabilization of the national and the world population and to the promotion of human development and progress. The Chinese Government is willing to continue its efforts together with the international community to effectively solve the problem of population and development. The Chinese Government firmly believes that China's population and development cause will develop further in the 21st century and that China will make still greater contribution to the civilization and progress of mankind! . Current Situation and Prospect 5. Since the 1970s, especially since the initiation of the reform and opening-up drive, China has formulated a basic state policy to promote family planning in an all-round way so as to slow down population growth and improve population quality in terms of health and education. The Government encourages late marriage and late childbearing, and advocates the practice of \"one couple, one child\" and of \"having a second child with proper spacing in accordance with the laws and regulations\". Family planning is also advocated among the ethnic minorities. Various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government have formulated their own policies and regulations according to local conditions. 6. The Chinese Government pays great attention to the issue of population and development and has placed it on the agenda as an important part in the overall plan of China's national economic and social development. The Government consistently emphasizes that population growth should be compatible with socio-economic development and be in concert with resource utilization and environmental protection. Since the 1990s, the Central Government has convened a National Summit Meeting on the issue of population and development once a year for the sake of adopting important decisions and measures based upon discussion and analysis of the major problems. The Government organizes and coordinates the relevant departments and mass organizations to implement the population and family planning program, striving to integrate the family planning program with economic development, poverty eradication, protection of ecological environment, rational resource utilization, universal education, advancement of public health and social security, and improvement of women's status. This is aimed at seeking a thorough solution to the problem of population and development.   \n",
       "1626  Full Text: China's economic, social development plan (8). II. Overall Requirements and Major Objectives for Economic and Social Development in 2008 In pursuing economic and social development in 2008, we must fully implement the guidelines adopted at the Seventeenth Party Congress, hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide and thoroughly apply the Scientific Outlook on Development. We will focus our efforts on transforming the pattern of economic development and improving the socialist market economy. We will continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation, work vigorously to advance reform and opening up and strengthen the country's capacity for independent innovation, and work hard to improve the economic structure and quality of economic growth. We must intensify efforts to save energy, reduce emissions and protect the environment. More attention will be paid to enhancing people's wellbeing and promoting social harmony as we strive for sound and fast economic development. In view of the above requirements and what is needed versus what is possible, and in conformity with the Outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, we have set the following major objectives for economic and social development in 2008: - Raising the quality of economic growth. We need to further improve the economic structure, accelerate the development of tertiary industry, increase the contribution of high-tech industries to the economy and increase R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP to 1.6%. Energy consumption per unit of GDP, sulfur dioxide emissions and chemical oxygen demand should fall by a larger margin than last year. Government revenue and corporate profits are expected to grow steadily. On the basis of structural improvement, improved efficiency, lower energy consumption and environmental protection measures, China's GDP is expected to grow by about 8% in 2008. A major reason for introducing the above targets for economic development is to communicate to society the government's regulatory intentions and guide all sectors to focus their work and attention on transforming the pattern of development, improving the quality of economic growth, saving energy and reducing emissions in order to achieve both sound and fast development. All local authorities should set targets for local GDP growth at an appropriate level in line with local conditions and avoid blind competition and setting targets at each administrative level that are too high. - Continuing to improve people's lives. Urban employment should expand by 10 million new jobs and the urban registered unemployment rate should stay at about 4.5%. The incomes of urban and rural residents should continue to increase fairly fast. Per capita net income of rural residents should increase by 6% or more in real terms. The new system of rural cooperative medical care should cover all rural areas and will receive more subsidies from the central and local government budgets. The number of rural people living in poverty should be reduced by 2 million or more. Fiscal guarantees to ensure adequate funding for compulsory education in rural areas will be strengthened. The program of free education for urban students taking compulsory education will be fully instituted. Natural population growth should stay within 0.7%. The major factors taken into consideration in setting the above goals are: national economic growth has been steady and fast for several years in a row, the financial strength of the country has further increased, the performance of enterprises has markedly improved and the impact of the vigorous employment policy is becoming increasingly noticeable. In addition, the implementation of policy measures to promote increase in people's incomes, especially that of farmers, and strengthen the social safety net has made it necessary and created the conditions for us to further expand employment, increase the incomes of urban and rural residents and address issues affecting people's wellbeing such as education and medical care.

Epidemics and natural disasters are on the rise around the world, especially in underdeveloped countries where expanding urban slums pose health hazards, according to a Red Cross report presented Thursday. The 200-page 1999 World Disasters Report said global warming, deforestation and urban crowding and poverty in the developing world are escalating the spread of contagious and deadly diseases and have left populations vulnerable to natural disasters. ``The developing world will continue to be hardest hit by the escalating effects of human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population pressures,'' said the report that was presented at the start of a two-day seminar in the Ugandan capital on preparing for and averting disasters. Red Cross regional spokesman John Sparrow said his agency had chosen to launch the report in Uganda because of the East African country's dedication to disaster-preparedness. Jane Francis Kuka, State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, said she found the report disturbing.   \n",

The Philippines is naturally prone  to disasters but rising poverty and climate change are making the  problem steadily worse, analysts said. Despite repeated disasters, many people are too poor to leave  dangerous areas, they say. Some 30,000 people fled the Mayon volcano when it started  rumbling in August only to return when the activity subsided. But  this week, typhoon-triggered mudslides swept hundreds of these  people to their deaths. Roger-Mark De Souza of the Washington-based Population Reference  Bureau said the danger from natural disasters here has risen  markedly in recent years. \"The risk to human life from natural disasters in the  Philippines has increased dramatically over the past generation,\" he  said in a recent report.   \n",

The social development strategies and policies of all national governments, formulated in accordance with their respective national political systems, economic levels and cultural traditions, deserve full understanding and endorsement, the report says. The report acknowledges that poverty eradication should continue to be considered the most essential social development issue. Poverty has always been a prime concern of all peoples, in particular the people of developing countries. However, the absolute number of the global poor population has not reduced, but rather is increasing. Until the basic rights to subsistence and development are met, the poor will remain unable to truly enjoy economic, social and cultural rights. The existence of huge numbers of poor people should cause all countries to be aware that global social development is only beginning. The Chinese government acknowledges that international cooperation for social development should be further strengthened. The international community should attach greater importance to the issues facing developing countries, and provide more assistance in the form of funds and technology. As they formulate their economic, financial and trade policies, developed countries should take into account the various direct or indirect unfavorable impacts these policies could have on the social development of developing countries.   \n",

Vietnam is intensifying its efforts on hunger alleviation and poverty reduction by striving to help some 300,000 poor households escape hunger this year. Vietnam has planned to reduce the rate of poverty-stricken households nationwide to 13.7 percent this year, Vietnam News Agency Saturday quoted Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs as saying. Vietnam now has 2.4 million households classified as poor, accounting for 15.7 percent of the total population. There are almost 1,500 poor communes nationwide each with more than 40 percent of their households classified as in poverty. Hunger and poverty eradication has been set as a major policy and an important undertaking by the Vietnamese government. The hunger alleviation and poverty reduction program started in 1992. The Vietnamese government planned to allocate 900 billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (64.3 million U.S. dollars) to the national program on hunger elimination and poverty reduction this year with 70 percent being channeled to the 1,000 poorest communes nationwide.   \n",

Norway pledged 240 million kroner (US$35.5 million or euro30 million) on Wednesday to a new global fund to help poor countries deal with economic shocks. The program was set up by the International Monetary Fund in November to provide highly subsidized loans to poor countries when their economies are hit by war, natural disaster or extreme fluctuations in import or export prices. \"This new scheme will act as a buffer and will help to ensure continuity in the fight against poverty, even in cases where vulnerable, poor countries have to deal with sudden severe economic shocks due to external circumstances,\" Norwegian Aid Minister Erik Solheim said. The fund, called the Exogenous Shocks Facility, was set up as part of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust following a proposal from the world's richest nations, called the Group of Eight. Norway, which is rich on offshore oil, is the world's largest foreign aid donor per capita.   \n",

Whether picking lettuces in California or cutting sugar cane in Brazil, agricultural workers across the world are the poorest of the rural poor, the International Labor Organization said Friday. Paid often exploitatively low wages, they face dangerous working conditions with little or no social protection in times of accident or illness.

Whether picking lettuces in California or cutting sugar cane in Brazil, agricultural workers across the world are the poorest of the rural poor, the International Labor Organization said Friday. Paid often exploitatively low wages, they face dangerous working conditions with little or no social protection in times of accident or illness. Child labor, bonded work or even forced labor is prevalent. In a new report ``Wage workers in agriculture,'' the U.N. Labor agency makes an in-depth study into the working conditions of the sector. It calls for action from the ILO's 156 member countries. ``Our basic message is you will find workers in poverty in California, in east and west Europe, in Africa and the Caribbean,'' said Philippe Egger, author of the report.   \n",

Venezuela has claimed about 600,000 hectares (about 1.5 million acres) of farmlands as state property to be turned over to poor farmers, giving hope to some while raising concern among others about the future of private property in the country. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel defended the agrarian reform program Thursday, saying Venezuela \"is broadening the system of private property\" by making lands available to poor farmers. \"That is social justice,\" he said. The government's National Lands Institute so far has declared 21 ranches to be state property, saying they were determined to be \"idle\" and those who claimed ownership couldn't prove it through documents. The government has helped poor farmers form cooperatives to start to work the land, despite legal challenges from those who used to run the ranches. President Hugo Chavez, who on Thursday took his anti-poverty message to the United Nations, said earlier this week that \"private property has to be subordinate to the general interest.\" However, he has insisted private property rights will be upheld, as outlined in Venezuela's constitution.   \n",

A World Bank conference closed Wednesday with words of hope for the poor and warnings of the threats of uncontrolled globalization and development. About 300 academics and World Bank officials from more than 70 countries spent three days at the Holmenkollen Park Hotel discussing how to alleviate global poverty. Norwegian Minister of Development Aid Hilde Frafjord Johnson, as host, closed the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics-Europe, or ABCDE, with a message of encouragement. ``I hope you have inspired the World Bank to take one step further toward pro-poor policies,'' she said. ``Let us leave this conference with a commitment to ensure that five years from now there are fewer voices of the poor.'' The World Bank, which says 1.2 billion people live on less than dlrs 1 per day, sought advice on relieving poverty through trade, aid and education to help reach the U.N. Millennium Development goals of cutting poverty in half by 2015.   \n",

Chinese delegate today called for the United Nations to \"pay more attention to the promotion of economic development,\" particularly that of the developing countries, in its efforts to realize the right to development. \"Currently, the most fundamental and urgent objective is to promote the economic development, particularly the economic development of the developing countries,\" Chinese delegate Liu Zhenmin told the 51st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which opened on January 30. As he stated, \"the goal of the realization of the right to development is to enable every human person and all peoples to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development.\" However, he said, it is hardly possible for one to enjoy all the human rights when a man had neither food nor clothing. Due to the \"unreasonable\" international economic order, Liu pointed out, most developing countries are suffering from heavy debt, deteriorating trading conditions and lack of financial sources, and peoples there a nightmare of hunger and poverty.   \n",

The government announced Monday that it would set minimum wages for farm laborers as from next year, saying the measure was necessary to protect one of the country's most exploited groups of workers. On average, farm laborers earned 544 rand ($58) a month last year, but some took home as little as 200 rand ($22). As from March next year farm laborers would have to be paid at least 800 rand ($86) a month in wealthy areas, and 650 rand ($70) in poorer regions, Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said. These amounts could be reduced slightly by farmers who gave their workers food and accommodation. Mdladlana said the fact that many farm workers were poverty stricken clearly illustrated the need for a minimum wage, but the government recognized that if the level was set too high jobs would be lost.   \n",

China has decided to raise its aid-to-the-poor funds from 5.5 billion yuan (688 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 8.5 billion yuan (106 million dollars) next year in an effort to improve its poverty relief. Chen Junsheng, a state councillor and head of State Council's Leading Group in Charge of Aid-to-the-Poor Projects, said here today that aid-to-the-poor projects provided by the Agricultural Development Bank of China, which was set up in 1994 to lend money to agricultural projects, are expected to reach 33 billion yuan by the end of 1997. He said the government has provided 10.8 billion yuan in funds for 592 poor counties, 51 percent of which is credit provided by the Agricultural Development Bank of China. Chen urged agricultural development banks and local government units to make still better use of the funds and to improve controls, and asked them to focus on local resources development and market-oriented commodity production with the use of science and technology. Chen said the credit must be repaid with interest, so the projects should be those that can yield a profit.   \n",

On this, I would like to make a few observations. First, since there is only one earth for us to share, ensuring its sustainable development is the common responsibility of all countries. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities for the developed and developing countries must be upheld. When apportioning the responsibilities for sustainable development, it is necessary to take full account of the uneven development of all countries, and abide by the principles of fairness, impartiality and rationality. The developed countries should take the lead in changing the ways of production and consumption that are inconsistent with sustainable development, take a more active part in addressing the global environmental issues and help the developing countries with concrete deeds. Meanwhile, the developing countries should also work hard and promote their development in their own countries along the requirement of sustainable development. Second, the global actions of sustainable development should give full respect for the sovereignty of countries and their independence in choosing their own path of development. The ability of each country to independently choose its own social system and development model in light of its national conditions and to retain control of its development process is the vital guarantee to effective protection of the country's environment and realization of its sustainable development. All countries should take positive steps, in keeping with their actual conditions, to rationally exploit and utilize natural resources, protect the ecosystem and promote a harmonious development of economic growth and environmental protection. While promoting economic development on their own soil, countries should also be watchful against possible harm done to the environment of other countries. Third, the environment issue bears on the common interests of mankind. International environmental norms should be formulated through the equal participation of all countries and reflect their wills and interests. In doing so, the difficulties of the developing countries should be taken into full consideration and their actual needs respected in an effort to establish a sincere partnership with them. Fourth, since the developing countries are faced with dual tasks of poverty eradication and environmental protection, it will be very hard for them to achieve sustainable development without a sound and supportive international economic environment. To them, a deteriorating environment is the result of poverty. Continuous efforts should therefore be made to combine poverty elimination with environmental protection. While giving continued attention to the global issues bearing on mankind's survival and development, it is necessary to help the developing countries with their own problems that have a restraining effect on their development. Reforms should be introduced to the international finance, investment and trade regimes. More transfers of funds and technology should be made to the developing countries to ensure their rights to equal development in the age of economic globalization and promote capacity building in these countries.

A World Bank conference closed Wednesday with words of hope for the poor and warnings of the threats of uncontrolled globalization and development. About 300 academics and World Bank officials from more than 70 countries spent three days at the scenic Holmenkollen Park Hotel overlooking Oslo discussing how to alleviate global poverty. Norwegian Minister of Development Aid Hilde Frafjord Johnson, as host, closed the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics-Europe, or ABCDE, with a message of encouragement. ``I hope you have inspired the World Bank to take one step further toward pro-poor policies,'' she said. ``Let us leave this conference with a commitment to ensure that five years from now there are fewer voices of the poor.'' The World Bank, which says 1.2 billion people live on less than dlrs 1 per day, sought advice on relieving poverty through trade, aid and education to help reach the U.N. Millennium Development goals of cutting poverty in half by 2015.   \n",

Thousands of workers rallied in Bangladesh on Labor Day on Sunday to demand the government set a minimum wage of 3,000 takas (US$50; euro38.85) a month and improve safety standards, weeks after a garment factory collapsed, killing 73 workers. There is no minimum wage in the poverty-stricken nation, in part because of opposition from factory owners. Inexperienced workers earn on average between 800 and 1200 takas (US$13 to US$20; euro10 to euro15) per month. \"It's a question of survival, we want the new guideline immediately to save our workers,\" Shirin Akter, a labor rights activist, told The Associated Press. About 5,000 people danced, sang and beat drums in a rally in Dhaka. They demanded the government implement a minimum wage and improve working conditions. \"We are here to create pressure on authorities to meet our demands,\" garment worker Amena Khatun said.   \n",

A human rights advocate concerned with sweatshop labor says some athletic apparel is made under dismal working conditions, and he is calling on professional athletes to help stop the practice. At a protest in Manhattan on Friday, Charles Kernaghan, the executive director of the New York-based National Labor Committee, spoke specifically about a factory in rural Honduras where he said the athletic apparel company Reebok makes some replica jerseys for the NBA and NFL. Among those he used as examples were the jerseys of Nets guard Jason Kidd and Giants quarterback Eli Manning. Reebok is the exclusive provider of official jerseys for the two leagues, and the company also makes replica jerseys. \"Women are locked in that factory compound 10 to 13 hours a day,\" Kernaghan said from the sidewalk in front of the NBA Store at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. \"They're paid 19 cents for every $75 jersey they sold. Their wages come to just three-tenths of 1 percent of the retail price, trapping them in misery. Overtime is obligatory; workers need permission to use the bathrooms; supervisors are abusive, yelling and cursing at the workers to go faster.\" If the 1,500 or so workers at the factory attempt to unionize, he added, they will be fired and blacklisted. The workers, mostly women in their 20s, are paid up to 82 cents an hour, Kernaghan said. A raise, he added, to $1.21 an hour would at least allow the workers to go from \"misery to poverty.\"   \n",

By spending more aid money on getting poor countries ready for disasters, rich nations could save thousands of lives, face smaller bills after floods or hurricanes, and boost the fight against poverty, the international Red Cross said Wednesday. The World Disasters Report, issued annually by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the economic and social cost of such events could be slashed if donors used their money more wisely _ before, rather than just after high profile disasters. ``Disasters aren't just little blips on the development curve,'' said Red Cross official Peter Walker, who edited the 239-page study. ``If we don't take them into account then we haven't got a chance'' of lifting poor countries out of poverty. Walker said donors should think like investors and target a larger proportion of their foreign aid to disaster preparedness. He did not suggest figures, but said the sums involved would be less than the current dlrs 6.3 billion a year it costs to rebuild after a catastrophe. The report said the number of people affected by natural and manmade disasters climbed to 170 million last year from an annual 70 million in the 1970s.   \n",

Contemporary forms of slavery remain a \"grave and unresolved problem\" across all continents, UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon warned on Wednesday, calling for greater efforts to address poverty and social inequalities which leave people vulnerable to enslavement. In a message marking the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, observed annually on Dec. 2, Ban said that the list of new and old forms of slavery is \"shockingly long.\" That list includes debt bondage, serfdom, forced labor, child labor and servitude, trafficking of persons and human organs, sexual slavery, forced marriage, the exploitation of prostitutes and the use of child soldiers. \"The majority who suffer are the poor and socially excluded groups such as minorities and migrants,\" said Ban. \"The overlapping factors of poverty, class and race create structural problems and cycles of marginalization that are hard to break.\" The secretary-general noted that gender inequalities, lack of education, desperation for work and demand for cheap labor also trap people in a life of subjugation, a vulnerability the global economic and financial crises threaten to heighten.   \n",

Speaking at a press conference here to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Nyambi said: \"As Africa today is experiencing a wave of democratization, most African country leaders are convinced that peace, development and democracy are mutually reinforcing.\" He noted that UNDP's overriding and central priority is poverty eradication within a Sustainable Human Development Framework, adding that without the basic democratic, social and cultural rights it would be difficult to attain the development objectives and most particularly food security which is the most challenging aspect of African continent. \"UNDP places human rights, good governance and sustainable human development as interdependent and mutually reinforcing conditions for eradicating poverty,\" he said. Judith Lewis, World Food Program (WFP) Resident Representative, said at the press conference that there are an estimated 800 million people around the world who do not have adequate access to food.   \n",

An economic shift away from agriculture has helped reduce rural poverty, but Mexico still faces staggering numbers of critically poor people in urban areas where low wages and unemployment are prevalent, the World Bank reported Wednesday. \"The agricultural income has dropped a lot,\" said Isabel Guerrero, director of the World Bank for Mexico and Colombia. \"However, the nonagricultural income has increased in an important way and the transfers ... such as remittances, have increased.\" Reducing entrenched poverty in urban areas has proven much more difficult, with no change in extreme poverty levels that can effect nutrition between 2000 and 2004, according to the study of income and social protection for the Mexican poor. \"In our urban report we see that part of this is a lack of networks and of contacts for the poor when they search for work, the stigma of coming from a violent neighborhood ... a lack of access to transportation and child care and the low quality of education,\" Guerrero said. A shortage of jobs pushes many of Mexico's urban poor into self-employment in menial jobs, beyond the reach of government social services in the past.   \n",

Migrant workers are lured to Malaysia by promises of high salaries but often end up being exploited and abused, Amnesty International says in a report that urged the government to better protect foreign laborers. \"Migrant workers come to Malaysia to escape poverty and to provide for their families. Once they arrive, however, many workers toil in conditions that amount to labor exploitation,\" the London-based rights group said in a report released Wednesday. Malaysia depends heavily on foreign laborers, who make up more than a fifth of the country's work force and fill jobs at construction sites, factories, restaurants, households and palm oil plantations. But lower-than-promised wages, unsafe working conditions, and arbitrary arrests and extortion are common, said Amnesty. An Amnesty team visited Malaysia in July 2009 and interviewed more than 200 workers -- both legal and illegal -- for the 100-page report titled \"Trapped -- The Exploitation of Migrant Workers in Malaysia.\"   \n",

The Tanzanian government has decided to establish a poverty eradication division in the Planning Commission. A statement issued here on Tuesday said that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) would assist the Poverty Eradication Division to develop a national strategy and programme. Under an agreement signed here recently between UNDP and the government, the United Nations agency will provide 703,000 U.S. dollars to add to the government's input of 150,000 dollars in the first phase of the poverty eradication project.

Development Listing. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said that Uganda has gained more economic and political development over the past years. UNDP representative to Uganda Daouda Toure made the remarks when launching the 1999 UNDP Human Development Report in Kampala Monday. According to a UNDP report, Uganda is ranked the 158th of the 174 countries, up from 160th last year. This indicates that Uganda is now the 17th poorest country in the world, up from the 14th poorest last year. Uganda still has potential for improvement if the current economic and poverty eradication policies are pursued, Toure said, adding that this east African country still lagged behind compared to its neighbors like Kenya and Tanzania.   \n",

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday said that \"understanding causes is the first step to successful prevention\" of the humanitarian challenges. namely the natural disasters and armed conflicts in the world at large. The statement was contained in Annan's annual report on the work of the United Nations, which, released here Thursday, is to be submitted to the upcoming 54th General Assembly session, scheduled for September 14. On natural disasters, Annan said, \"The world has experienced three times as many great natural disasters in the 1990s as in the 1960s -- while emergency aid funds have declined by 40 percent in the past five years alone, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Today's disasters are sometimes man-made, and human action --or inaction-- exacerbates virtually all of them,\" he said, \"Poverty and population pressures increase the costs of natural hazards because more and more people have been forced to live in harms' way -- on flood plains, earthquake-prone zones and unstable hillsides.\" \"Unsustainable development practices also contribute to the rising impact of natural hazards,\" he said. flooding.\"   \n",

The United Nations Development  Program (UNDP) is working on a national human development report  on Zimbabwe to enhance human development knowledge in the country, the official news agency New Ziana reported on Tuesday. The project will focus on gender and development for the period 2005 to 2007, and is expected to pave the way for pro-poor and  gender sensitive policy-making in the country. \"The Zimbabwe Human Development Report is an output of a broad  consultative process, rigorous research and analysis over a period of two years,\" said the UNDP. \"The publication of the report in 2006 will be followed by  extensive dissemination and advocacy campaigns to key policy  makers and the nation at large,\" it said. The Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, as  the government arm mandated with poverty reduction and monitoring  activities, would implement the recommendations of the report.   \n",

It is \"a terrible indictment of the world in 2007\" that 18,000 children die every day because of hunger and malnutrition, and 850 million people go to bed every night with empty stomachs, the head of the U.N. food agency said Friday. James Morris called for students and young people, faith-based groups, the business community and governments to join forces in a global movement to alleviate and eliminate hunger -- especially among children. \"Addressing the hunger issue is the most powerful way to break the poverty cycle,\" he said in an interview. \"We all simply have to do more.\" \"The little girl in Malawi who's fed, and goes to school: 50 percent less likely to be HIV-positive, 50 percent less likely to give birth to a low birth weight baby. Everything about her life changes for the better and it's the most important, significant, humanitarian, political, or economic investment the world can make in its future,\" he said.

The young workers came from Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, spending their own money to work in summer resort towns desperate for labor. Many of them wound up cheated out of wages and overtime pay, working jobs that violated child labor laws or docked pay to cover room and board. A state investigation last year found that nearly 200 foreign workers were cheated by several companies in an upstate resort town. The state ordered the businesses to repay the employees, plus interest, and pay state fines. Some of the companies are appealing the ruling and more than three months later, about 180 students who worked for the companies between 2002 and 2006 are still owed $103,000 (euro66,809) in pay, interest and fines, according to state Department of Labor records. \"Forcing these international students to work overtime without pay is criminal,\" said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, a human rights organization. \"To overcharge them for rent, what an image it gives. These students go back as ambassadors to their countries. What they'll have to say about the United States is that this is a nasty experience.\" Nationally, The Southern Poverty Law Center found \"legal guest workers\" in the U.S., in some cases students, are at risk for abuse and exploitation. A report issued in 2007 by the center said many workers were promised higher wages or were given fewer weeks of work than promised.   \n",

Last year's Asian tsunami hit poor people far harder than the middle class and wealthy, and the aid effort could worsen the income gap in affected regions, a major aid group said Saturday. Nearly six months after the enormous Dec. 26 disaster, Oxfam said those aiding the survivors must work hard to reach out to the poor and help them build better lives than they had before. Just replacing the destroyed assets of landowners and businesspeople would leave behind those who owned little, and exacerbate the divide between rich and poor, the agency said. \"Desperately poor people have been made poorer still by the tsunami,\" said Oxfam's Britain director, Barbara Stocking. \"The generous response of the public has put us in a strong position to address these problems. We must use this as an opportunity to help people work their way out of poverty and to ensure they are better placed to deal with natural disasters if and when they strike again,\" she said.   \n",

Earth leaders called here in a key UN document adopted Wednesday for immediate action to address the causes of ill health and their impact on development with particular emphasis on women and children. In the document entitled \"Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD),\" they agreed the goals of sustainable development can only be achieved in the absence of a high prevalence of debilitating disease while obtaining health gains for the whole population require poverty eradication. The world leaders urged in the document to strengthen the capacity of health-care systems to deliver basic health services to all in conformity with human rights and fundamental freedoms. They called on to implement all commitments agreed in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the UN General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session within the agreed frames. It is agreed in the document that the effort should be focused in particular on the reduction of HIV prevalence among young men and women aged 15-24 by 25 percent in the affected countries by 2005 and globally by 2010.   \n",

The young workers came from Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, spending their own money to work in summer resort towns desperate for labor. Many of them wound up cheated out of wages and overtime pay, working jobs that violated child labor laws or docked pay to cover room and board. A state investigation last year found that nearly 200 foreign workers were cheated by several companies in the Lake George area, a collection of resort towns an hour north of Albany. The state ordered the businesses to repay the employees, plus interest, and pay state fines. Some of the companies are appealing the ruling and more than four months later, about 180 students who worked for the companies between 2002 and 2006 are still owed $103,000 (euro65,770) in pay, interest and fines, according to state Department of Labor records. \"Forcing these international students to work overtime without pay is criminal,\" said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, a human rights organization. \"To overcharge them for rent, what an image it gives. These students go back as ambassadors to their countries. What they'll have to say about the United States is that this is a nasty experience.\" Nationally, The Southern Poverty Law Center found \"legal guest workers\" in the U.S., in some cases students, are at risk for abuse and exploitation. A report issued in 2007 by the center said many workers were promised higher wages or were given fewer weeks of work than promised.   \n",

Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday announced an increase in the minimum wage paid to workers in Britain, a move seen as an attempt to increase support for the governing Labour Party before elections expected in May. The government announced that the minimum wage would rise from 4.85 pounds (US$9.26, euro7) to 5.05 pounds (US$9.64, euro7.3) in October for workers aged 22 and above. The level for workers aged 18-21 will rise from 4.10 pounds (US$7.82, euro5.93) to 4.25 pounds (US$8.11, euro6.16) in October. Speaking at his monthly news conference, Blair said the minimum wage was a \"a powerful symbol of how this country is changing for the good.\" The increase is likely to delight trade unionists, an important force within the Labour Party. Some business leaders are concerned, however, that such an increase is unsustainable. Blair has argued that low wages create a poverty trap, encouraging people to draw unemployment benefits rather than finding work. The issue is likely to figure prominently in national elections, with Labour reminding voters that the main opposition Conservative Party rejected the minimum wage in the 1997 election campaign.   \n",

Tanzania needs a sustainable human development which generates not only economic growth, but also distributes benefits equitably, a senior government official said Tuesday. Addressing a meeting organized by European Center of Education and Agriculture, Minister of State in the Vice-President's Office Daniel Yona said that Tanzania needs a development which gives priority to the poor, enlarging their choices and opportunities. \"It is a development that is pro-poor, pro-jobs, pro-democracy, pro-women and pro-children,\" he said. However, the minister said poor Tanzanians must themselves lead in the struggle against their own poverty, instead of waiting for external support from developed countries, international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations. Yona said that the government has already identified sectors such as education, health, water, rural roads and agriculture, which will be given proper attention during resources allocation each year.   \n",

Finnish President Taria Halonen on Monday defended globalization, saying that it can increase ways of overcoming poverty and strengthening sustainable development. \"Globalization is not only economic cooperation, we must pay attention also to social, cultural and environmental concerns. Global concerns call for global ethnics,\" Halonen said when addressing the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) here. The poorest countries need to gain access to world markets, but the markets are not enough. So this requires more development cooperation and investment as well as liberalization of trade, Halonen said. She noted that the International Labor Organization has set up a World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization, which is co-chaired by the presidents of Finland and Tanzania. The commission has the task of identifying policies that will reduce poverty and stimulate growth and development, she said, adding that its goal is to propose means by which as many countries and peoples as possible will be able to enjoy the benefits of the globalization.   \n",

Some 400 residents of Argentina's poorest province are gearing up for an all-out hunger strike to raise awareness about their dire situation, Nobel Peace laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel said Sunday. \"La Quiaca once again stands up for the rights of the poor and marginalized through an extreme measure,\" the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize winner told reporters in Mar del Plata, Argentina's top beach resort on the Atlantic Ocean. Esquivel said the hunger strikers would begin their fast Monday in La Quiaca city, in eastern Jujuy, to protest the lack of federal and local government attention to the province's social problems. The hunger strike, said the human rights and anti-poverty advocate, will last \"until the final consequences.\" He said Mar del Plata was chosen for the strike announcement to contrast the glitzy tourist center with Jujuy, where 30 percent of its 620,000 inhabitants \"face extreme poverty ... hunger, and child malnutrition plagues many homes.\"   \n",

Eighty-six percent of working Indians earn less than 20 rupees or half a dollar a day, untouched by the country's blistering economic growth, a government- backed study said Friday. Out of 457 million workers, 395 million are employed in the so-called unorganised sector -- in areas such as agriculture, construction, weaving and fishing -- the study found. \"Only 0.4 percent of the 395 million unorganised sector workers have access to any form of social security,\" added the report from the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector. \"... 79 percent of unorganised workers ... earn less than 20 rupees (49 cents) a day,\" it said describing their living conditions as \"sordid,\" and \"utterly deplorable.\" \"No social security, pitiable working conditions, extreme poverty, no education, acute gender discrimination, and absent or poorly implemented laws - this is what India's workers live by,\" said author of the report and senior government official Arjun Sengupta.   \n",

Kenya on Monday called on African countries to invest more in social protection strategies when breaking the vicious cycle of poverty. Kenyan Vice President Moody Awori said that there is need for countries in the continent to set aside certain percentage of their national resources to address social inequalities facing the less privileged and most vulnerable members of the society. \"Our countries need to invest heavily in the poorest and most vulnerable by deliberately directing a certain portion of the national income to the less fortunate. However, social protection should focus on long-term assistance and addressing the root cause of social inequalities,\" he said. Awori made the remarks when he officially opened the Regional Workshop on Cash Transfer Programs in Africa for Vulnerable Groups at the coastal city of Mombasa. He noted that such a move would help the poor and vulnerable groups to effectively tackle issues affecting them besides participating fully in the economic growth of their respective countries.   \n",

Ugandans on Wednesday were called to reduce the number and impact of disasters by building sustainable communities that have the long-term capacity to live with risk. The call was contained in a statement issued by Lt. Gen. Moses Ali, first deputy prime minister and minister for disaster preparedness and refugees, to mark the International Day for Disaster Reduction which falls on Oct. 8, 2003. Ali said the theme of this year's International Day for Disaster Reduction is \"turning the tide on disasters towards sustainable development,\" adding that \"this theme is reminds us that the task is not just to effectively respond to disasters in order to save lives, but more to reduce the chances of hazards turning into disasters, taking life away and destroying development gains.\" \"In Uganda, drought, floods, landslides, windstorms and hailstorms destroy an average of 800,000 hectares of crops making economic loses in excess of 60 million US dollars every year. Economic loses resulting from transport accidents and fires is estimated 25 million dollars annually. Death tolls resulting from natural and man-made disasters exceed 5,000 annually. Between 1980 and 2003, 1 in 30 people in Uganda were affected by a natural or man-made disaster and fell into the poverty bracket,\" he noted. \"At intervals of 5 to 10 years, an earthquake occurs in western Uganda destroying infrastructure and property estimated at over 40 million dollars. Also between 3 and 5 years periodically an El Nino rain phenomenon occurs followed by a severe drought in Uganda, also causing destruction to property and infrastructure estimated at over 200 million dollars,\" he said.   \n",

Bangladesh has made a good progress in fighting hunger and reducing food insecurity over the last decade, but even now the intensity of hunger remains high partly due to its large population and dangerous outcome of repeated natural disasters, national news agency BSS reported on Wednesday. ActionAid, an international anti-poverty agency working in over 40 countries, in a recent report ranked Bangladesh 15th in fighting hunger out of 52 developing and developed countries. The report said Bangladesh still has the third highest number of hungry people in the world, after India and China. And around 39 percent of the South Asian country's under 5 years old children are underweight and 27 percent of the total population suffers from malnutrition. The report said the number of food insecure citizens reduced from 40 million to 27 million over the last decade in Bangladesh. But, largely due to high food prices in 2007 and 2008, the number of Bangladeshi people facing food insecurity has risen with the cyclone Aila further adding to the pressure. The country has improved nutrition level among children below 5 years in the last two decades, but still has a long way to go to combat malnutrition, the report said.   \n",

A senior aid official warned a Europe-Asia conference Monday that development funds alone would not get poorer countries out of their financial difficulties. Koos Richelle, director general of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office, said aid by rich nations must bring tangible results. He cautioned that \"not a single country has been lifted out of poverty as a result of development aid alone.\" \"The key factor has proved to be the quality of leadership and governance, or 'ownership,'\" Richelle added. \"Development cooperation is just one element and should be based on respect for that ownership. Donorland is not Disneyland.\"   \n",

The European Union is expected to give Cambodia about 187 million U.S. dollars to help the country to improve social sectors which are critical for its development cooperation in 2007, an EU statement said on Thursday. The aid will be used in economic cooperation, health, education and rural development, but the big focus is on the reduction of poverty, private sector development, administrative reform, decentralization and human rights, Winston Mc Colgan, the charge d 'affairs of EU to Cambodia, said in the statement. \"We are confident that the EU funding will contribute substantially to the Royal Government of Cambodia's efforts to develop the country,\" he said. The plans of fund are detailed in the annual report about EU's development cooperation activities in Cambodia, known as the Blue Book, which was presented to Mr. Keat Chhon, Cambodian Minister of Economics and Finance, by German Ambassador H.E. Mr. Puis Fisher and Mr. Winston Mc Colgan, the statement said. Keat Chhon was also presented with the EU road map for increasing aid effectiveness, it said, adding that the Blue Book and EU road map are part of the EU's efforts to increase aid harmonization and alignment through better coordination.   \n",
